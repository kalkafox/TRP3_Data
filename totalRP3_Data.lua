The beige fur, softer than the silk she buried herself in, flickering in the light to give a more highlighted display to the brilliancy of pink warbling around her irises, gentle hues of cyan blue waters playfully dancing across the glassy orbs they belonged in - a playground of infinite cosmos locked inside of almond-shaped, black lined eyes of cherubic countenance. Her lips held the same lined features, a soft and smooth snout curving in a feminine manner to the black nose that so many had been a victim of nuzzling from. Such slender and delicate features only added to just how well her large ears added, the whitish fluff that puffed out from them a direct and perfect contrast to the darker lining of her skin. And yet, should one look hard enough, the skin on her pelt was indented ever so lightly above her left eye - a scar, forever a reminder of both her abuse and her past. \n\nHapi struts the lands with a smile on her face, no matter the time of day. Her attention often varied from person to person, but the universal constant of Hapi was that she was always ready to deliver the happiest and most delicately lined smiles ever given - no matter the reason. Waters swirled around the glassy orbs, pink irises a portal into the world of the Elements that sang around her. Her hips swayed and bounced with her movements, in a constant dance to the song that the Elements blessed her with. She was content to flash a happy wink and ask whoever she was closest to to come dance with her.\n\nOften times, Hapi is seen with a guardian. Whether this be Muhri, her sister, or Oshi, her brother - or another trusted member of her caravan - Hapi was well-tended. These guardians tended to be fiercely protective of the little Vulpera, and with fine reasoning. Her innocence and cherubic countenance often times landed her in a situation befitting someone of a more skilled caliber, and Hapi herself certainly did not fit witihin that catagory. Her guardians, however, did. They keep a -very- watchful eye on her, making sure that nothing and nobody gets their hands on her. She seems to adore their presence.\n\nHigher, slim cheekbones held the peak as her smooth and slender snout met down to her well-rounded chin. Black-lined lips over her muzzle, shaped and smooth, colored and shaded to add onto the girl's sandy beige fur, these lips were simply another great addition to such a blessed face. Leading up to her well-proportioned cheeks and up, were her eyes, alive with emotion and extremely animated, Hapi’s large eyes expressed how she was feeling before words even left her lips. They bounced and pulsed with elemental energies at all times, ranging from droplets of wonderous cyan leaving her irises to a dormant shimmer and dance of water glimmering around her large orbs.\n\nHer body was in great shape. Legs finely toned with lean muscle met a slender shape, meeting up to graze up to her large, round hips. Being slender and curved more towards complimenting her rear, this was her greatest 'asset', as it were. Her hips met dipping curves on the girl's sides, leading up her body to a generously sized chest, perfectly shaped and rounded to a robust and attractive form. It seemed obvious that Hapi was the pinnacle of a genetic lottery, although her body was well-proportioned in a way as to not make it overwhelming. She held the grace and piquant of a dancer, one who spent her time freely wiggling in the hours, bringing the rains with each swing of her well-rounded hips. Her midriff was delighted and blessed with a serendipitous curvaceous renature, connecting the bubbled and sublime hips to the twin baubles hoisted upon her small frame. Despite being very short, even for a Vulpera, Hapi's body was beyond developed, honed and toned from years of her dancing and elemental craft. Her chest formed well in any of her clothing that tightly snuggled along her proportioned, light, and supple shape. Her fur was angelically soft, blessedly settling over the canvas of her pelt in wonderful tufts and holding grips. Despite her rather sinful form, Hapi is the exact opposite of what most hope for, and is a chaste pure little bean that truly only seeks love in the form of friendship.\n\nHer personality was one easily read. Open, blunt, cheerful and giggly, she's most commonly referred to as 'cute' or 'adorable' by how bouncy she was. High energy  almost all of the time, completely engulfed in the joy of simply being alive... not too good at being able to switch into an attitude of stoicism when the situation needed. {/col}{/p}\n\n\n{p:c}{col:5cbbff}============================================================{/col}{/p}\n\n\n",

She calls on them to enhance her other elemental abilities, and on occasion calls for the aid of a rock elemental she dubs 'Rocky' much to it's dismay.\n\nRixxa is also a fairly accomplished alchemist and mixes up all kinds of potions and tonics that can be useful. Her own personal mixture is a drug called 'Anti-Out' which acts like a hyper adrenaline shot, increasing energy, keeping one awake and alert, and works well for hangovers as well! However, open wounds will lead to one bleeding out faster.\n\nShe is resourceful, often using the environment to her advantage and adapting life experiences into tools that can aid her, in combat or otherwise. One such 'tool' is a bag of extremely spicey, hot pepper powder, that she will use when someone needs a good roasting.\n\nAs a goblin, Rixxa has at least a decent understanding of technology, even if she doesn't tinker much herself. She has purchased a Sky Golem that she can call upon to get around, or help her mess someone up in a pinch.\n\nWhile she does use magic, Rixxa was a bruiser for the Bilgewater Cartel for time.

Her violet hair was kept in a hastily tied ponytail, with lengths and tresses tucked behind short, pointed ears.\n\nShe carried a single edged sword at her belt, and often some sort of enchanted trinket or bauble to compliment it. She wore a satchel slung around her torso which stank of pungent herbs and odd magical reagents.

Now, however, the man has returned to what he once was before being held as a tortured captive. To bare his heavy plate armor and wield the weapons he was most accustomed to once more, the man has regained what muscle he had lost and is back to being rather bulky for an elf. As what might seem to be the usual for him, the paladin takes on a constantly dour expression that seemed to be always brooding over something or another. Though, a touch of softness might be found twinkling in his now glowing gold eyes. Both his hair and full beard were of a pale blonde that most may guess had been striking during his younger centuries, but the passage of time and a turmoil of events have left it lacking in luster. \n\nThe paladin sports a multitude of scars accumulated throughout his lengthy military career as well as personal endeavors. While the scars vary from the mundane nicks to wide cuts, the most prominent one would be the jagged scar running down the length of the left side of his body with the scar tissue beginning just above his left eye and ending somewhere on his left thigh. Though his body would have to be exposed to see that along with a majority of the little nicks and cuts. Besides the scars, the elf now has two new additions to his list of past injuries that have left a mark upon his form. Or rather, the lack of. The male’s right ear has been cut in half horizontally and seems to have been topped with a piece of metal to hide the skin’s potential deformity and the paladin’s left arm had been completely severed at the shoulder.{/p}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/655261742309441555/672815547632582670/Illustration133_2.png*Art of Art!} Art done by @rustfuse on Twitter!\n\n{p:c}Armaments of War: Given his chosen position in the frontlines of war or battle of any sort, the paladin takes to equipping himself in the heavier forms of armor, mostly of matching plate and chainmail that allow him to be protected from the larger varieties of danger. His commonly chosen set was not as regal or ornamental as many other elven warriors might choose, but it did not mean that there wasn’t some semblance of his race’s heritage amidst the design of his breastplate at least where his house’s crest of a crow was engraved. On occasion, the elf takes to adorning a light robe over his chosen regalia or simply a light kilt that billows out from his belt. In an even rarer instance, he will take to forgoing both robes and kilt, instead vouching for a heavy cloak to cover his armored frame. As for weapon of choice, the elf’s experience with war has allowed him to bring all manner of weapons to the battlefield, but he is most commonly found wielding a sword of sorts in battle.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sunlight:512:128}\n{h1:c}{col:ac5614}Common Inventory:{/col}{/h1}\n{h3}-Regalia of the Reforged\n-Blades of the Fallen House\n-Libram of the Reforged\n-A tight coin purse (Visible)\n-An odd coin (Hidden)\n-A waterskin (Visible)\n-Enchanted Flask (Partially Hidden){/h3}\n\n{h2}OOC Notes:{/h2}\n\n{h3}May know Art via:\n-Veterans of the Second or Third War.\n-Having the faint recollection of a fallen house amongst Silvermoon's nobility (Kor'serrar being the original name).\n-Knights of the Silver Hand or fellow Light wielders associated within the order.

Bingo is at his side usually around Stormwind.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-HYJALPAST:256:128}\n\nBackstory of Zarshal:\n\n- Zarshal was born in Gilneas City when he was younger, But he wanted to explore the world when he gets older, See what the world has to offer for him.\n \n- For now, His parents taught him some training. Starting with Combat. Zarshal was told how to fight when he was 10 years old. Fighting against a target dummy made of wood planks, Using a wooden sword. It happened for two weeks. He has to know combat before anything. His parents then taught him survival, then after it's all done, Training taught and such. His parents decide to do fishing. Selling fish to the local travelers who visits Gilneas city and citizens of the city. He then was living out with his family for a while, For the rest of the days he has.\n\n- It was all peace and quiet until the forsaken attacked the city of Gilneas City, Which was at the age of 15. Luckily he was taught how to defend himself and his family gave him 50 gold before the attack happened, But he knew fighting forsakened would be dangerous, So he just ran out of the city, Hoping to find a better city that he calls 'home'. He traveled for a week, Staying on the road where it's more safer. As he was traveling, He was living off eating Bread and drinking water he bought from the local travelers. He then found a city with walls, Zarshal was happy to find this. A city with walls and guards patrolling around is a better place for him. He then walked inside the city. He's in a better home now. After a few years, Zarshal decided to help a few people out, See what he can do to help. He lived his life now as a wandering Alchemist now, Partly being a Scout. He knew it would come in handy in some ocassions.",

His memories are blurred between two different caravans. He's not real fond of the idea of becoming part of one again. Upon hearing the Vulpera joined the Horde he made his way to Orgimmar. Only to end up moving to Silvermoon City after several months attracted to the amount of books there.\nHe will read just about anything. Whether or not he comprehends what he reads is in question. This love of reading has been noticed by several other Sin'dorei and was offered a job.  He accepted and now is 'The Storytime Fox' for the kids in the library. Most of the children assume that he is an enchanted animal mascot for the library.  Gotten found of butterflies.\n    \nIt was suggested that he dress better to fit in the city. Having gotten used to such robes, his people's traditional garb is strange to him. Isn't entirely sure why everyone thinks he is a priest though.\n\nExtremely naive and taking most things people say to be the total truth. He keeps a good attitude about things, when he isn't on the run from things. He finds taller races interesting, willing to risk his tail being stepped on to talk to them. When surrounded by his friends, he gets a little cocky. Often not sure what personal boundaries are with his friends. Its rare to see his cowardice among his friends. \n\nYears of undernourishment from his bad caravan life has left him on the scrawnier side. Moving to Silvermoon has given him more food access but he still hardly eats. Still preferring the fruits and bugs of his previous life to the heavier foods.  His fur is dark grey and near white of standard pattern. Most of his fur unusually plush, with his tail looking like it belongs to something of bigger proportions. Keeps most his thinner side hidden with fanciful robes topped with a matching hat. Recently has dabbled in excercise aim to stregthen up some.\n\nCurrently sleeps in a large basket a tailor shop. The owner keeps sewing new outfits for him to wear. Along with a almost never ending supply of shampoo. If he thought about it hard enough, he might realize he was being treated like a pet.\n\nHe often speaks in third person. More practice lines will usually have him speak in first. He will get your name wrong the first few times. Maybe even forever. Knows several parlor tricks that has helped him avoid being eaten while living in the desert by larger animals. His extreme flexibility is a surprise to most.\nHas taken an interest in the healing arts. Slowly being trained by the priests at Silvermoon. Though he doesnt seem able to grasp it firmly. Is more secure in non-magical methods of healing.\n\nUnsure of relationships. Having been burnt really bad in the past. This has ruined his self confidence when it comes to attracting someone. \n  \n{h2}Quirks{/h2}\nEasily gets crushes on males.\nLoves Books\nPampered\nSpeaks Thalassian ((Tongues))\nThose trained in the Light may notice butterflies sitting on his hat or ears.\n\n{h3}Etc.{/h3}\n\nNotes on his Caretaker Mooncraver:\nSindorei Tailor whose childern have all growned up. Sees Kamille as a pet and subistute child.\n\n\nCharacter Art:\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/yuta7e7c*Floating Around}\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/ycpgjgv6*Kamille's First Date}\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/y7hw5yec*Kamille's Butterfly}\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/4n6huk7h *Puppy Eyes}\n\nLooking for artwork?

As she grew older and was trained by the caravan's guardians, however, that unbridled fury was tempered and restrained, to be deployed when the safety of her family was at stake. That fury is what earned her the nickname Sandstorm, for any who got caught in the crosshairs of her ire were subsequently beaten and left to the dunes as her namesake left its own victims.\n\n(( It's a WIP so things will be added when I'm not lazy af I don't think people actually read these things anyway ))\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-89:64:64}\n",

As reinforcements in the Second War, they served alongside the other Orcish forces in the Burning Steppes at the foot of Blackrock Mountain, only to be met with defeat at the hands of the Grand Alliance. His parents would carry on to Kalimdor with their surviving kin, finding work guarding make-shift ports in Tanaris, aiding convoyers and shipping routes for the Horde in the North. All was well, and not long after Khan'gar was born. \n\nAt the age of 5, Ogre aggressors stormed the port, overrunning and slaughtering all, including the boy's parents-- leaving him orphaned. A mere child, the Ogres who organized the ambush swiftly apprehended Khan'gar and several other Orc refugees, selling them then to various slave owners scattered throughout Tanaris and the surrounding regions.\n\nKhan'gar would remain a slave, working in mines until the age of 14, when a wayward Horde patrol from a Northern territory known as Durotar came upon, and liberated the enslaved Orcs from the Ogre overlords.\n\nIt wasn't long after that, once identified as belonging to the Warsong clan, Khan'gar was sent to the Valley of Trials to make a full recovery, and begin his instruction under the Elders.{/col}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:ff1411}Training and Placement{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\UI-LFG-BACKGROUND-OUTLAND:256:128}\n{col:ffa36c}Khan'gar's mentors early on found the boy to be largely reclusive, unwilling to interact with others. It was several years before the shock of his enslavement had begun to dull. All the while, Khan'gar demonstrated a higher than average intelligence, and a keen instinct for combat very much befitting of his status as a Warsong Orc. He was groomed from a very early juncture with one word in mind-- \"war\".\n\nHe would spend his days under the tutelage of his masters, recieving a series of tests and challenges that most would consider especially brutal. But, so they must be for an Orc to be effective in battle. His training finally reached it's conclusion at the age of 21, whereupon Khan'gar set out to complete his trials.\n\nAmong them, his first was to collect a heavy stone and carry it upon his back to the den of his enemy-- several small bands of Demons and consipirator summoners, where he carved through them with ease. A series of slayings including ferocious beasts, monsters, et cetera followed after. Customary to the Warsongs, he then sought to break a wolf of his own. He found a large pack, and engaged in battle with it's largest member, barely surviving the ordeal. Some time later, and with considerable coaxing, the wolf came to see him as it's master.\n\nWith this, his fellow Warsong deemed him \"Wolfrider\", and the young Orc's trials would be complete.{/col}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:ff2011}Service to the Horde, the Fourth War{/col}{/h2}{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-DraenorOrc:512:256}\n\nWIP WIP WIP\n\n",

I don’t need anybody going behind my back and trying to bend me over. We’re all stuck together so we might as well get along.”\n\nOn women\n\n“I’d say every man needs a woman who can go toe-to-toe with him verbally. Let’s face it, we’re pig-headed and sometimes we need help when viewing things. Used to call my wife ‘the bride of Ragnaros’ because she could be fire incarnate when I wouldn’t listen.”\n\nOn Orcs\n\n“Strong people with a strong culture. I’d be proud to stand side by side with them in battle. Let me command an army of Orcs and I can take every city on Azeroth. Let me command one Orc and he’ll make you give me that army.”\n\nOn Tauren\n\n“I’m ashamed I made a few beef jokes back when I was young and stupid. They give the appearance of gentleness, but you see then in battle and no word can describe their ferocity. Some of the most kind and hospitable people I’ve met.”\n\nOn Forsaken\n\n“They got the raw deal. I see one and I’m reminded of what happened to my home and people. Then I have to remind myself they had no choice. Even free they’re bound by all that negative energy, it’s not like they have much of a say in how they act.”\n\nOn Trolls\n\n“Good natured, good fighters, and I’ve seen them have a good time. To be honest, the accent makes it hard for me to know what they’re saying.”\n\nOn Goblins\n\n“Yeah, I’m a bit iffy on them. They can get whatever you need, if you don’t mind the price.

Thought he was hot shit, but I tell you right here right now, he was one of the WORST I ever had to deal with. For some reason daddy gave him the idea that rules don’t apply. So after a large amount of infractions I put the brat on guard duty. Check on him… He’s not there. Eventually found the son of a three-legged kodo in an inn. He’s in there bragging to the ladies about how’s on his way to being a captain and how great a Blood Knight he is.\n\nSo I grabbed the worthless piece of trash and proceed to beat him.\n\nAfter that favors were exchanged, hands shook, and bargains struck. All this behind closed doors and I wasn’t included. It wasn’t so much what I did as it was I did it in front of a crowd. So my punishment is a loss of rank, patrolling Kalimdor, and the twerp… At least he’s not a Blood Knight.\n\nAm I happy with the situation? No. I accept it though, especially if it keeps the runt away from ever being a Blood Knight.\n\nContinue to petition for reinstatement, See all these new threats and want to join the battles, I want to serve in a better capacity.\n\nDenied.\n\nSo that’s why I’m here. If you’re ever this way again bring some of that nice baked bread from Silvermoon. I miss it. \n\n(( You made it this far? Why hello there!

Green Fel hues sprouted from his attire, from the pauldrons that held a swishing goo. To the collar that also served as a mask.

A constant stubble ornaments his statuesque jawline, his lips soft and full with subtle laugh lines that frame the corners of his mouth. His eyes are a dark teal color, dancing closely to appearing blue, showing a minimal level of fel corruption in him.\n\nHis body is toned, a lean physique chiseled from years of a healthy and challenging lifestyle. Were one to get him out of his clothing, his body held some scars from wars past: typically small cuts or arrow wounds that have left their mark, though he was no stranger to being on the receiving end of a blade. His right arm masks some of these with an elaborate tattoo of water flowing down a river, surrounded by various flowers from all around Azeroth. It covers his entire right arm and his pectoral, where a whirlpool is inked into his skin.\n\nHis voice holds a soft rumble to its tenor, his tone often hushed and husky when speaking one on one with someone. His hands often move as well, gesticulating as he speaks. He never shies away from darker or risque topics or debate, more than willing to dive headlong into deep conversation.\n\n{h3:c}Hooks{/h3}\nValadrin may have been seen in port towns or cities, particularly Booty Bay, where his permanent home is. His most frequent haunts are Silvermoon, Suramar, Uldum, Tanaris, Zuldazar, Orgrimmar, and Ratchet. He's likely garnered a reputation for being a smooth-talker, but a reliable and (mostly) legitimate business partner and information broker (aka, paid gossip) for anyone willing to do business. For business he doesn't do, he can point people in the right direction. He may also be known in some circles as a good painter and orator.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:250:50}",

Not much is known about her early life as at a young age, she was taken by the Sethrak for their slave markets. Under a cruel slavemaster, she endured his increasingly sadiststic tendencies for many years until one night in a frenzied rage, she carved him to pieces and fled to the wastes. Whisper would wander Vol'dun aimlessly for a time. Striking out at Sethrak hunting parties, and using the natural diseases from the land to poison their more renowned figureheads. Eventually, she would garner the attention of Vulpera requesting her assistance, as well as Zandalari exiles in need of dirty work to be done. Her work would soon begin to take her from Vol'dun and further into the outside world. To this day, Whisper continues to offer work to discreet and contained circles of unscrupulous figures across Azeroth. She has recently begun work with a number of new business partners. \n\n                                             {h2:c}Attributes{/h2} \n Whisper has always been self-trained. She has learned and adapted to killing since her slave days. She most commonly uses a pair of jagged steel knives. Designed for effectively bleeding out her foes. Whisper's most infamous staple of her work are the poisons she utilizes. Rather than typhical venoms commonly used by rogues, she instead uses deadly diseases found across Azeroth and turns them in to sickly mixtures always dressed on her knives. Her signature toxins can cause suffocation, rapid fungal infections, tetanus, irreversable paralysis, and (if you're on her bad side) a specialty concoction that boils the blood and gradually melts the body from the inside. If Whisper can inflict any death possible, she will make it painful, meticulous, and violent.  \n\n                                                 {h2}Personality{/h2}        \n  Whisper is committed to her work and does so with a sadistic aura and a oddly cheery demeanor. She will appear confident, courteous, honest to her clients and associates, and loyal to her craft. Whisper doesn't ask for a high price for her work, believing the effort is more worthwhile than the reward.  However, she is difficult to contact(excluding close associates). Whisper has a habit of taking any measure to conceal her prescence. She will always remain mobile, and will mostly avoid heavily populated areas. She is easy to approach, but is very short when it comes to speaking, or just uses facial gestures when responding. Whisper finds it difficult to remember not only most reoccuring clients, but friends and family from her past as well, questioning at times if they ever existed in the first place. \n\n                                               {h2}Appearance{/h2}     \n Whisper's outfit can be considered common among many scoundrels. Garnishing dull browns and grays, with a mask draped over her muzzle. Whisper never goes anywhere without her supplies and carries a cleverly hidden bag with her specialty toxins and an assortment of serrated knives. Around her neck is her \"Good Luck Charm\". A glowing sky-blue gem strung by a coil of rope Whisper has carried throughout her life. Whisper's fur is snow-white, lined with silver streaks. Beneath though are numerous scars invisble to the naked eye. Her most noticable ones are a serpent-shaped brand engraved upon her back, and a long cut down the left side of her muzzle. Whisper stands at a diminulative 3 feet and 4 inches and is scrawnier than most other vulpera.                                                                                           ",

The steel he wears seems rather battle-worn yet still strong, destroyed and ripped apart just to be put back together again, much like the scarred orc who wears it.\n\n• At any given moment, the orc probably has at least some sort of blood splattered on him, combat being a daily thing for him.

On the rare occasion he'll keep his thoughts to himself, mainly to avoid a senseless fight.\n\n• Drokgar has tempered his bloodlust, no longer angered at the drop of a hat like he was when he was younger.

Or is it the fate we all wish to avoid. Uma'baba is not sure~... It would require a few more gold. Yeees~. Just a few~. Handfuls,\" the hooded creature said, jutting out a hand to receive payment. The other hand hovers over the gentle illumination of a crystal ball, taming a vision that spells out the fate of the wary male goblin.\n\nWide-eyed, the green shorty quickly shoves both hands into each of his pants pockets respectively! The Soothsayer began to grin, tilting his head back to give a bit of revealing light to his shady hood. The sound of precious gold! That's exactly what he was after. Overexcited, the Vulpera bounced within his seat and coaxed the goblin on with the payment. Who was greeder at this point? Hard to tell considering the situation.\n\n\"Yes, yes! Ooooh-ooh~. Yes... YEEEES~! Uma'baba sees it now. Mmmn... Riches, piles of loot, oil barrels for the taking. ARMFULS OF,\" the Vulpera pauses, leaning closer to whisper the big surprise, \"Growth elixirs.

Place them in the urn on the way out. Not get out. OUT! NEXT!\"\n\nThe goblin nods as if pleased with his fortune, screaming in delight, \"Oh! OH Thank you! Thank you! I'm so excited! A new lease on life! Now I can afford that boat! AND MANSION! AND MY NEW RANK!\"\n\nThe Vulpera smiled and reassured the customer, \"Yes~ YES! All of it... GO. Go now... Time is money. Money~ Uma'baba needs.\" A claw pointed as the goblin took his leave, waddling out and tossing the gold within the tall brass urn toward the exit. That delightful noise! Coins falling upon coins, collecting, setting into an unseen pile of uncounted riches!\n\nA quiet maniacal chuckle came from the odd creature, slamming his fist into the table before screaming, \"NEXT! Come! The Darkmoon Faire has your fate kept inside Uma'baba's tent! Know how you succeed! Or fail~! Next into Uma'baba's tent and learn of your fate~! Come on in, before it's to late~! NO REFUNDS!

She holds an hourglass figure but modest features. Adorning her face and body are hoops and studs piercing her flesh, the only other body mod she has are the mystical markings. Within each marking is a name of a demon, either one she has made a pact with or one she can summon. \n\nShe keeps her head shaved close and holds no other body hair aside from her brows. She holds an unconventional beauty to her, she is very rarely seen with make-up on. Her fashion is average these days as she no longer holds the wealth she once had. You can see her dressed often in robes and dresses, often sporting a skull or two, dark colors is what she favors.

Since her exile, she has had a hard time coping with the change of the world she is now a part of.\n\nTallax is rarely ever seen with any sort of Demon in tow. As a Demonologist, she knows it is uncouth to have one displayed. She also seems to feel shame and holds a deep-seated ire for even having the knowledge of how to summon them.\n\nGlancing at Tallax you would see she can fight, but would rather not, it is important to know that she will defend herself, and if she is outmatched she knows when to cut her losses, but she is no coward.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{icon:inv_misc_book_16:25} {col:8cff57}History{/col} {icon:inv_misc_book_16:25}{/h3}\n \n{p:c}All info below is general info Tallax would share. I urge you to find out more about Tallax's history in character.{/p}\n\n{p:c}{col:781dc6}Tallax belonged to a family of Vinters in the upper class. With the return of the Legion and the Shal'dorei split. Her family wanted to retain their status and sided with the Legion in hopes that they would get favorable treatment. Forced to learn the dark arts of Demonology a pact of dark knowledge was forced on her. She was forced to help summon the minions of the Legion through the war. Her family was slaughtered and she was captured. She spent some time in a cell before she was given the option, leave and never return or rot for the rest of her days.

Adopted by two loving mothers at an early age, knowing nothing of an earlier past nor family, life was good. Between the love, the care, schooling in magic and martial art, sports activities and more, living couldn't have been better. For decades happiness wasn't even a thought but a constant. Then tragedy struck the kingdom. Arthas had come with a terrible might and waged a genocide. Even those who were not soldiers stood up and fought for their lives and the lives of those they love. Not all were lucky to survive, a vast majority lay upon the ground growing cold. \n\nAs they say, in the Light you are reborn. Its just that... There are different kinds of light. A bright blue hue raised consciousness, a shriek casted out. Full of fury, sadness and pain. The beginning of a new life, a second chance. Not without it's struggles. Many days spent sitting before a mirror, staring endlessly, wrapped in thought and trying to decipher everything. A lack of emotions, the intensity of other emotions, coming to terms with what that mirror reflects, understanding the deep and dark eternal cold.\n\nThough it was soon learned it is not all bad. Acceptance the hardest part, and after, unlife becomes so much more easy to manage. Advantages over the mortal coil. The lack of need for sleep, drink, food and the extinction of fatigue and typical pain. In this state the draw to magic much stronger than before, bolstered in fortitude. This lending itself to the physical. The ability to leap great distances, scaling walls and lifting weight not able to while alive. A new degree of confidence having grown over time. A complete cycle come to end. The understanding of totality.\n\n\"Abracadaver\" is now her name. The world her playground.{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98t-SaHaEj4*If it's worth dying for, will it seal the deal?}{/h3}\n",

She felt no danger around the sethrak, no fear of the giant beasts lurking in the sands. If anything, she seemed to find them entertaining. She was always smiling around the dangers. Few encountered Sayana and gossip about her was surprisingly rare. Her preferred company were the naga and tortollans, effortlessly communicating with both despite the ancient animosity between the two races.\n\nSayana was always an enigmatic creature of unknown origin that had no notable traces left on the world, no history or records to prove she existed at all. As a vulpera, she rarely left the coasts or deliberately sought social interaction. Her presence in Vol'dun was far more noteworthy as a sethrak. A black scaled creature with striking amber eyes, Sayana had left a far greater impact in Korthek's empire than she ever had as a vulpera. She was seen as a scholar of magic who held no fear in channeling dark magics.\n\nThough her interest in mortals had always existed, Sayana often restrained the impulse to engage them more. She found the sethrak terribly dull and the vulpera visually appealing but culturally insignificant. She held great contempt for caravan culture and the traditional ways of the scavenging desert wanderers. It was not until her chance encounter with a unique young vulpera that lived with tortollans and Zandalari exiles that she became more personally invested. The child was a rare find as she possessed neither the branding of a slave or the corrupting influences of caravans. The potential to share her beliefs and experiences with the young vulpera filled Sayana with a new sort of excitement.\n\nThe young vulpera, Kyleeh, adored Sayana and worked hard to make the ancient being proud. While Saya rejected the title of mother or any obligations of parenting, she opened the young vulpera's mind to the wonders of the world. Sayana's expectations for Kyleeh were vague at first. She taught the young vulpera magic and basic combat skills. As Kyleeh grew up, Sayana grew increasingly attached. Though the few years together were nothing compared to the untold thousands spent on Azeroth, Sayana felt those interactions were some of the most meaningful. Kyleeh and Sayana would go their separate ways during the onset of the Fourth War but Kyleeh would find her way back to Sayana after a series of personal tragedies. She would take Kyleeh to the safety and comfort of Orgrimmar.\n\nSayana had integrated within the ranks of the Horde by slipping in with the rest of the vulpera population. She was intrigued to watch how the vulpera adapted and changed with new powerful allies to offer power and opportunity to a race she derided as submissive and helpless. During this time, Sayana would find herself drawn to the beautiful white furred vixen warlock Mako Snowhide. She sought the attentions of this lovely vulpera, sharing both intimate secrets and physical intimacy with Mako. Their romance progressed from lovers to wives as they wed. Sayana felt a deep inner conflict about Mako's finite lifespan and offered to confer immortality upon her beloved wife. She patiently awaited Mako's decision...",

They were scared, ashamed and felt remorseless guilt; or at least Kelekolnir was experiencing those scarring emotions. Fighting orcs, trolls, tauren and the rest of the Horde was one thing, but this was entirely something else. To march into a city of defenseless civilians and cull them like animals? The mere thought had Kelekolnir shaking in his boots. But.. deep down, he didn't see any other way - this had to be done.\n\nThe thalassian killed many people that night--people he had come to know as his own. Their culture and lifestyle was his now. These were his people. But despite those thoughts, he decimated them out on the streets, in their own homes and even while they slept, showing no mercy or hesitation to anyone in his path of shame. The only thing he cared about was protecting Lordaeron and his family; and that thought alone would guide the elf through his dreaded duty.{/col}\n\n",

Once risen, Goregut was not fond of his apperance nor the fact that his arcane studies and skills failed him. When he discovered what he now was he became enraged, burning everything in his sights causing absolute chaos. Goregut grew to hate his teachings through his now new life which led him to dive into a new greater and more destrustive power, the Fel. Still enraged by what happened, Gore began to subtly change and began to alienate his allies and accepting his new demonic \"allies\" for they had the powers he seeked. When the time came, the demons tried to take Gore under their influence. Goregut was able to overcome his would-be-posessors and still manage to use his new known power, but at a price. The struggle and conflict caused his armour and his flesh to bond, mutating him into a monster. Startled by this, Gore was now willing to not only keep and use his powers, but be wary of them as well. While his now new allies respected him for resisting the demonic influence, they also feared him..for he was still and unstable threat..  .{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-warlock-cover:256:256}\n\n{h1:c}Current Image{/h1}\nRecent events have now caused the Forsaken standing before you to look almost normal, but he still looks very odd. His apperance is very strange, for it seems his armour has still taken a toll on his skin after finally being removed. His face is almost completely gone, a few fleshy bits still remain but most of it is fleshy bone at this point. His voice is less haunting but still deep and raspy. His skin is still some shade of green, almost an acid color except for his fingers which are just bone at this point. His hair is long and white and somehow still intact.\n\n{h1:c}Currently{/h1}\nGore now roams Tiristfal Glades mostly, alone and afraid to ever show his face ever again. He tends to the Deathknell graves, even if most of the Forsaken had abandoned them. Most of his fellow friends have not seen him since he went on the quest to find his mate after she went to seek out the Old Gods. He seems a bit cuckoo but can you blame the guy? He has not seen his mate since, and has slowly grown cold and twisted.\n",

Big, explosive things.\n\nHowever, for the first decade or so of her life, Ruby had never even SEEN an explosion. Her father, traumatized by his experiences in the Second War, sought to live a simple life and had cloistered the Rumblebolt family away to a remote corner of Kezan to farm sweet potatoes and raise pigs. However, due to Mister Rumblebolt's phobia of modern, combustion-based technology, it wasn't long until the industrialization of Kezan rendered the Rumblebolt farm obsolete and subject to hostile takeover.\n\nAnd boy, was it hostile.\n\nGoblin Gyrocopters armed with machine guns and explosive missiles descended from the sky strafing the pigs, bombing the fields and indiscriminately killing everything on that farm.\n\nEverything except young Ruby, who stood atop the roof and shouted: \"WHOO-HOO! HOTROD OF DA SKIES!\"\n\nObsessed with fiery, explosive death and newly orphaned, Ruby spent her adolescence savaging scrapyards, tinkering and generally slumming it. A childhood depraved of dangerous explosives gave way to an obsessive mania in the young goblinette to learn as much and experiment as much with ordinance and machinery as she could. And soon she joined the Bilgewater Military as one of many expendable Experimental Turbocopter Pilots fighting in the Fourth War.\n\nSince the war's end, and with Ruby's handlers missing in action and presumed dead, there's little stopping this hyperactive goblin from wrecking havoc upon the general populace.\n",

Two shaped patches of the darker fur surrounded both eyes, and two slashes of bare skin showed on the right eye...with the addition of his more recent injuries. \n\nRecently, Feng has shorten his hair a tad. No longer long enough to keep a ponytail, he simply had it smoothed back on the top of his head. \n\nArmor:\nThese days, Feng has found a set of armor that he's keen on keeping with him. This one was clearly more cared for than his previous set; the dents and scratches dug into his other one did not show on this one. In fact, it appeared to be almost new. Purple was the obvious theme for the set, with hints of other dull colors decorating the rest of it. A serpent was designed onto his left shoulder guard, breathing purple fumes. A more elegant-looking bow rested onto his back, though he could also be seen carrying around a polearm.\nSecond Armor:\nHis second set was far more heavier, and clearly meant for close combat. Most of the armor showed a grey-black mix of colors, with white decorating the trims and one glove. The rest of it, in the heavier parts of the armor, would be a goldish-yellow. There were a few pieces that had spikes stiking out...and they were as dangerous as they looked, enabling Feng to use them as weapons if needed. His right arm and paw was the most armored out of everything...though the gauntlet opened up towards his fingers to allow use of them more easily. To finish the look, the hunter had a cloak draped down his back...and a polearm resting against his back. He could sometimes be seen with a bow instead.\n\nHe had two scars; one noticable immediately, one hidden away.  His right leg, close to the knee, had a bald spot the size of his paw. The fur there didn't seem to be growing back. It appeared to be some kind of burning injury.\nThe second scar, or scars, would be three claw slashes across his right eye.

Her body seeming to lack much of any unneeded fat. Chest fairly small, nearly flat as a result of such. Light patches of skin from scars, and smoldering runic tattoos, mar her tanned skin. Dark hair would roll down her shoulders, and extend to the length of her mid back, in the right lighting, one could see it was a deep red, nearly black. The demonic traits that graced her form, were no different than any other fel-altered being. A pair of horns that curled up and back over her skull. Slightly more pronounced canines, and claws seeming to have replaced both finger and toenails. The most uncommon mutation being the slender tail that wrapped itself around her waist, keeping itself away from swinging blades.\n\nThe attire that this woman wore, were often dark, form fitting leathers or more traditional red and gold Sin'dorei themed clothing. More often than not, revealing and exposing the warm runic tattoos. She didn't seem to mind what so ever of the attention it drew. Over her eyes, rested a blindfold, often a simple black and silver, or red and gold style. Resting between her pair of horns, was a ruby, enchanted with flame that caused a crown of fire to circle her head. Floating just under the horns, and above her hair. \n\nMore recently to her wardrobe, was some finely crafted jewelry. A ruby band around her left wrist, that spiraled it three times, with white crystal inlays that gave off a prismatic reflection of light. On her neck, was a choker of a purple hued metal, bound together with magic, and embedded with gems of different colors.\n\n\n {link*https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/300444197700370432/517191637252702218/demo2.jpg?width=744&height=465*Art WIP}\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffc81b}Public Knowlege{/h2}\n\n{col:ffffff}-Faelsyn was born from the union of Dalaran dwelling nobles of House Shadowfeather and Goldenmist, some time around the first war.

She spent her adolescent years growing up on a small ranch. \nHer family was composed of farmers and brewers, working closely with their neighboring shao'din. \nThey were especially close with the Tillers and the Anglers, enabling her to grow up with capable abilities and skill in farming, fishing and agriculture. \n\nHer family mainly lived a quiet life, but had roots that spread to every coast of her land.\n A majority of her historical family were practicing monks- many of which were enslaved by the Ancient Mogu Empire. \n\nWhen the Horde and Alliance brought their war to the shores of her homeland Muji's family was struck with great pain.\n The once peaceful brewing family was especially susceptible to the negative power of the Sha. \n\nHer close relatives were all negatively impacted by the emotions the Sha caused them to discover. \nMuji herself was prone to lashing out in bouts of anger and violence. She often felt despair, doubt, hatred and fear.\n Her peaceful way of life was turned upside down, her family now hurtful and violent to eachother. \n\nShe decided to venture off into other parts of her land to train, hoping to better herself and help fight the Sha that were ruining her homeland.\n Many of the temples of Pandaria were her home as she learned from all aspects of the Celestial families.\n She found the magics of the Elves that her family once spoke of more and more tempting as the Sha corrupt her heart and mind. \n\nEventually, after spending time learning how to control the magics, she returned to her family in the Valley of the Four Winds to find them all but gone.\n Her parents were missing, assumed dead. In all her anguish, the Sha found her vulnerable and entered her mind once more. \n\nShe took refuge at Halfhill, spending her time tending to a small farm at Hillsong Ranch. \nThe local shao'din knew nothing of her inhabitance for months, until she grew more weary of her own thoughs and emotions and \nweakly collapsed at the market in her bodys  desperate attempt to seek help. The locals befriended her until she was strong \nenough to leave once more, vowing to use her knowledge in magic to help purge the lands of the Sha. She took up history in the meantime,\n learning the cause of all the events around Azeroth that ultimately lead to the pain that she now felt. She perfected her brewing, \nan old skill she learned when she was young, to pass time and make ales to ease her pain. In her attempts to brew, she found herself \nat peace with nature, learning how to collect valuable resources and tend to the earth... But the ales she brewed and farms she tended\n were only masking the effects of the Sha. \n\nShe had nightmares, and would occasionally find herself lashing out. The more she tried to control it, the less in control she felt- \nboth over her emotions and her magic. \n\nA great movement began to rid Pandaria of the Sha and the Horde leader that was using it for his own plotting.\n Muji found herself aligned with secretive factions such as the Golden Lotus and the Shado Pan. \nShe met a mysterious group of foreigners the she also rather liked. With the help of them and many more,\n Garrosh Hellscream was defeated and the power of the Sha began to lose it's grasp on the lands. \nMuji found herself relieved and at ease, but also faced new obstacles. The fight was won but there was more to be done.\nIn a moment of clarity she decided to fight for and with the Horde against any forces that were a threat on this world. \n\nDespite the time that has passed and all the challenges that she has faced, deep inside the Sha still touched Muji's heart. \nShe often found herself in the midst of chaos, something she felt at home with. \n\nMuji is honest and forgiving in nature, but her negative emotions sometimes still make her shut herself off to \naccepting wrongs and forgiving people. She is hesitant, but well-earned trust is not something she takes lightly.\n Those that have earned this trust are often easily forgiven. \n\nShe aims to help others, not wanting another soul to feel as she ever did, hoping to do everything possible \nto keep the peace in the world. She is gentile at heart but her past and her drinking habits sometimes turn \nher into a drunken mess. With the negative effects of the Sha, Muji is often very superstitious, \nand uncontrollably impulsive. You'll find her drunk and wild in social settings, or otherwise quiet and reserved.\n She can be timid, but sit down and have a drink or two with her and Muji will open up and be more welcoming. \n\nHer loyalty is only paralleled by her curiosity and desire to seek more knowledge.\n Muji hopes to  gain more comrades that she can one day accept into her own shao'din, as her own family.\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-PandarenTortureDummy:512:256}{col:2b2b2b}{col:303030}{link*http://your.url.here*Your text here}{/col}{/col}",

The berserker has spent much of her life in shackles, chained behind bars, only to see the light of day when being transported or fighting in the arena. Through her years, she has had multiple masters, sold again and again, forced to fight the races of Azeroth in the pit, including kin for bloodsport. The admiring cheers of the crowd when she mutilates her opponents is the only sign of approval she knows, and the lash the only sign of failure. Over her years, she's accumulated multiple callsigns from her masters to make up for her lack of a name. 'Goremane', 'The Snarling Jackal', 'Bloodfrenzy' to name a few. Finally, after so many years of enslavement, she has broken free of her shackles, slain her most recent master, and escaped. With her newfound freedom, she wanders the world, lost and confused, but determined to find her place.\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-NAGRANDARENA:256:256}\n\nThe she-orc before you is a telltale sign of hard fought battles and harder victories. A thick mane of gore red hair dresses her scalp and frames her dark green face to the shoulders, pulled and twisted into thick braids bound by leather strips to manage. Her face is best described as 'savagely beautiful'. She possesses thin dark brows, the left halved from a blade's strike, leaving a scar that cut down across her cheek to her jawline. Beneath those brow lay her feral orange eyes, the lids lined with a thick plume of lashes. Seated in the center of her face sits her round nose, the bridge licked with scarring, the septum pierced with a bone fragment. And below her nose sits her full pouty lips, a set of tusks jutting from the corners of her mouth. Dark tattoos reminiscent to wild swipes and slashes mark her cheeks and chin. Her pointed ears are pierced with an assortment of claws and bones, with a mixture of fine gold rings, the lobes stretched with solid gold plugs.\n\nThe berserker's form has been shaped and molded by the arena, crafted to be an effective killer in the pit. She stands at solid six foot one, her womanly curves being the only trace of fat on her body. She carries her head upon a slender neck, her throat forever marked with the scarring of shackles. From her broad shoulders hangs her toned arms, the flesh tattooed with the same tiger stripe-like slashes, with a plethora of scars marring her skin, along with similar shackle-scarring on her wrists. Her palms are rough and calloused, ripped and healed over a dozen times from battling vigorously with an axe in each hand. Her back is a canyon of muscle definiton, the flesh hard like leather from the roadmap of disciplinary lashes that marr her pine green skin. Her chest carries upon it a hefty bust, and beneath lies her flat washboard abdomen, licked with close-calls scarring that cuts across her naval. Her strong, thick haunches support a taut rear, her legs trimmed from her years spent sprinting across the arena to clash with her opponents, the flesh tattooed and marked with battlescars like the rest of her form.\n\nThe She-Orc struggles with her self identity since finding her freedom. All her life, she's always been a gladiator, her name-titles constantly changing with her varying slavers. She struggles to interact with most, coming off as skittish and feral in nature towards newcomers. Simple interactions, and even the way she eats and drinks is beast-like in nature, even for an orc. The berserker doesn't share the same concept of 'honor' as her kin do, prone to sack, pillage, and steal for the sake of survival. But like any wolf, with a little time, the she-orc can prove to be a loyal companion.\n\nThe she-orc wanders the world in her gladiator attire, a collage of plates, chains, furs, pelts and silks of different racial motifs. A thick, rigid iron helm sits atop her head, flared with a feathery mohawk comprised of horse hair, dyed blood red. Along her collarbone sits a golden usekh, a decorative collar of Tol'viri craft. A thick leather tunic dresses her torso, the hide embossed with a tribal pattern along it's seams, with large tusked plated pauldrons fastened to her broad shoulders, and a simple pair of fur-lined steel cuffs shield her forearms. A thick girdle wraps around her hip, a human's skull fastened into the front as a decorative piece with dangling strips of reinforced leather covering her crotch. The girdle suspends an abundance of weathered tiger pelts and tattered Tol'viri silks around her hips that flow freely around her trouser-dressed legs, with decorative chain-link gold and even femurs jingling and clacking about. A pair of bolted fur-lined steel boots complete the berserker's set.\n\nA pair of hatchets dangle from her hips, the fighter's preferred weapons of choice. The right-handed blade, a hatchet of orcish make, chipped and jagged from it's use and sharpened a dozen times over. It's long hilt is wrapped in an abundance of thick hide strips and fixed with a spiked handguard, with a jagged blade serving as it's pommel. The blade that accompanies her left hand, a wicked hatchet of ogre origin. The curved blade shares the same battle-wear as the other with a wicked curled hook crafted on the end of the leather-wrapped neck.\n\nYou may know the gladiator if:\n\nYou've frequent arena fights: The she-orc has been in countless fights over the years during her enslavement, going by different callsigns with each new master. Perhaps you've seen her fight? Maybe you were a fan even? Or maybe she won you a hefty sum of gold from your bet?\n\nMercenary work: She's been getting by in the world by killing for coin, be it beast or man alike. Perhaps you and her shared the same bounties, or maybe you hired her?\n\nYou were, or are, a gladiator: With this she-orc being carted from one arena to the next for most her current life, there's chance you've met her. Maybe you've encountered her in one of the underbellies of the arenas gearing up for her fight. Or perhaps you've fought along side her, or even against her? It's not uncommon for team coordinators and slavemasters to pay extra to have their best gladiators spared from execution. Perhaps she almost ended you, or you her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Cain, one who would insist they spare their formalities towards him but he addresses everyone else with utmost respect. Speaking to Gravy as though he was the Regent Lord, a fearless huntress as though she was a shining jewel standing out at a ball. He is also a curious soul, he's always been fascinated with the way a person's mind works, it should not come as a surprise if Cain would attempt to try and understand a person on a deeper level from early interaction.

Yes, even that, but it would all be for Cain's personal indulgence, everything sticks with his character\n\nI believe history should be RP'd out instead of simply read from a profile. I will however, mention that **Cain has a very dark side to him**, you should write with me to find out more. :)\n\nPlayer may be slow on posts here and there, i care about the detail and the way i write, please be patient with me\n\nI am always open to writing long term and building stories, shoot me a whisper if you're interested!\n\nResonating has two different rp profiles for two different rp characters, dont be alarmed you know me on either character and see that my character's completely different\n",

Perhaps he did once, but if that is the case he certainly doesn't remember it anymore. \n\nTen is a vulpera of rather unimpressive stature. More lithe and effeminate than most males, his equally short muzzle and curved facial features look more at home on a female than a male. Although he at least has the big ears thing going for him. His body is also covered in sandy tan fur with white vulperan underbelly, accented with the typical plains markings. \n\nThose vulpera that know Ten either shared a fate similar to his own or heard it from someone who did. A fox that lifted spirits in the Fathless slave pits, Ten was always so find of his cards and his scrying. Many positive outlooks could be found in the telling of destiny, and Ten's captors did not enjoy the idea of their slaves having fun.\n\nSo they saw fit to beat it out of him. And the brutality of the Sethrak was highly imaginative. It's unknown exactly what they did to him, as he either refuses to speak or shuts down in the effort. But one thing was for sure. Killing him meant making him a martyr to the other slaves; and the idea of killing all the unpaid labor meant getting behind schedule. Or doing it yourself. And Sethrak aren't very DIY.\n\nStill, Ten did his cartomancy and his divination in secret and even took up his slave name, Number Ten, after having had his old one beaten out of him. More so, he added his own sense of purpose to it, becoming known by his nickname amongst the other slaves: The Wheel of Fortune, the tenth major arcana in his deck. Of course the Sethrak kept destroying his cards, so he had to continually make new ones.\n\nAnd then, one day, he wasn't in the camp anymore. Sethrak bodies started to pop up. And with earthen spikes nailing copies of the tenth card to their chests.\n\nEither he figured out how to do shaman things or he had help doing shaman things. No, he probably did shaman things...{/col}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-ShamanRestoration:256:128}\n\n\n",

Everything about her seems to be small, like her scarred hands, her lightly freckled nose, and particularly her ears, which immediately give away her human heritage. Yet, a better look at the little elf tends to reveal a strength to her body which may usually be overlooked due to her size and general physical appearance. Rhiannon is a slim woman but with a toned body, with strong arms and rather broad shoulders, forged by years of marksmanship and more than a few violent brawls in random taverns at the end of the world. Her human heritage has given her icy blue eyes, round cheeks and soft facial features, which make her look quite different from full-blooded elves. Despite her hatred towards the idea, she definitely looks more adorable rather than delicate and sharp. {/col}\n\n{col:f15c16}As for clothing and style, she tends to stick to lightweight mail and leather armors, the one she currently wears is dark mail of fine Pandaren craftsmanship. She can often be seen carrying an old leather backpack and some small pouches strapped to her hip, which carry various little items that she believes to be relevant (such as medicinal herbs, coin, or something she found on the floor and decided she wanted to collect). {/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:c745f9}Personality{/col}{/h2}\n{col:f15c16}To put it simply, Rhiannon is a young soul, seemingly unburdened, joyful and friendly. The Halfling carries herself with an unusual confidence for those of her kind. Years of odd looks, whispers, and inapproptiate questions about her blood don't seem to have taken much of a toll on her bubbly and generally nice personality. The woman has traveled around a lot with goblins and it -shows-, got their eye for business and the lack of filter. Her good qualities, however, can sometimes be eclipsed by the bad ones. Rhiannon struggles a lot to focus and is very easily distracted, tends to zone out a lot and makes lots of mistakes due to not paying attention at the proper times. Her desire to move around, explore, and do everything at once can sometimes make her seem too insensitive or a little flaky, lacking the ability to pour her time and attention into one task only. Even with these complications in mind, however, Rhin tends to have an energy that is nice to keep around if one can handle her goofiness. The woman likes to have fun and enjoy the simple things in life, like attempting to drink people under the table (and failing spectacularly at it), spending time in nature, befriending animals, and punching dragons (note: not serpents, DRAGONS!). {/col}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:c745f9}Background{/col}{/h2}\n{col:f15c16}\nRhiannon Sunwrath came into this world as a glimmer of hope to a depleted bloodline. Teanna Sunwrath, a formerly distinguished and famous Blood Knight, saw in this child a chance to save her house from vanishing, and raised the girl with this concept always present. From the very beginning it was only the two of them against the world, living out in the Ghostlands and rarely ever meeting with other people. Rhin never questioned this life of seclusion and secrecy, as she was completely unaware that there were alternatives. Her greatest and most joyful interactions occurred whenever her cousins, the Bellators, came to visit. She didn’t get to see the four girls often, but they always treated her like she was just one more sister. \n\nGrowing up, Rhiannon was taught how to fight, forage, explore and survive, and she was a good learner, but Teanna always pushed her limits until the little girl was left tired and on the verge of tears. Teanna wanted a soldier, and a child who would continue their bloodline, but as Rhin grew up she proved to not be viable for either of those things. At some point during her teenage years, Rhin got sent to the house of one of Teanna's friends to live there for a while. She doesn't seem to remember the years or events that went down during her time there, but she believes it's merely because it was an irrelevant, dull point in her life. \n\nAfter this event, the elf allowed her child to go out and explore the world. Since money was no issue at all, Rhin got to travel pretty much wherever she wanted and was left in awe of how different the world was then she’d always thought it to be. Eventually, the girl started taking jobs as a mercenary or hunter, as she had both an affinity and talent marksmanship. During this time moving around fighting things for money, she eventually stumbled upon a group of goblins, travelers like her, and vendors of rare items. Rhin joined them as their bodyguard, and this gave her access to new resources and opportunities. Rhin's adventures travelling with the goblins were cut short a few months ago when they got lost at sea. Most succumbed to the elements and lack of resources, but Rhin and two others managed to make it.\n\nThe young woman has been stuck in a strange place for the past few months, she has been living in Pandaria recently, watching over the baby one of her cousins recently abandoned, and trying to find some new direction in life. Not too long ago, she stumbled upon the Order of the Cloud Serpent, and has been training with them ever since. Only recently she moved up from the rank of trainee to warrior, and she's excited about her new position. Other than that, she spends her days moving between Orgrimmar and Pandaria, clearly still craving some excitement and adventure. \n {/col}\n\n{h3}{col:c745f9}Additional Rhin facts:{/col}{/h3}\n{col:f15c16}- Has lacunar amnesia and ADHD, so she tends to be a little clueless about what goes on around her, as well as some events that happened during her childhood and teenage years\n- Perpetually hungry, will steal your food\n- Sometimes will also steal other things, has light fingers\n- Do not, under any circumstances, give her caffeine. \n- She’s super friendly, but if you joke about her height she’ll kick you in the knees\n- Despite the friendliness, she can also be a little shy at times. Definitely functions better if surrounded by people she knows. \n- Likes: serpents, goblin and elven women, bows, booze, head scrtitches, fantasy literature, animals\n- Dislikes: dragons, people who talk shit about her height, elves that are too “elfy”\n{/col}\n\n\nOOC notes:\n- congrats on making it all the way down here, have a cookie\n- player and character are both an ADHD disaster, be patient plz\n- my first language isn't english, please don't murder me if I make any mistakes\n- looking for long term rp with this girl\n- sale su rol en español pa los que hablen el idioma? :v \n\n",

					["TX"] = "{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-AlliedRace-Zandalari:256:128}\n\n{p:c}A tall standing Zandalari, Valatl shows off what a true Zandalari hunter is. An athletic build that isn’t too large to slow him in his hunts or too weak to be overpowered by what he hunts. His long dark blue hair either flows freely most of the time or is sometimes seen to be tied and held in place with a golden circlet around his head. His ears and nose have no piercings, a sign of Val’s preference to remaining natural and simple while also not having the shine of gold give away his location during his hunts. Though, his large tusks which curve down and then up do sometimes have a pair of golden rings close to his jaws along them. Perhaps a little Zandalari flair for himself? And though he doesn’t choose too much jewelry he does have a small affinity for gold trimmings and accessories depending on the day or duties. Maybe it’s just a Zandalari trait. The last things to note of his visage are the bright, vibrant azure eyes he has and the small engravings carved into his tusks.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-hunter-cover:256:256}\n\n\n{p:c}Those strong and bright eyes gaze out with a deep calmness and wisdom within. Almost as if looking into the eyes of a resting Devilsaur lording over its hunting grounds, Val’s eyes and even form have a primal feeling about it. What gives that feeling off most would be the noteworthy scales that protrude from the Zandalari’s shoulders, wrists, and ankles. Instead of smooth plates flush to the skin, Val’s poke up and extend outward along the limbs almost like scaled hooks or barbs. This feature gives the Zandalari a more primitive and savage feeling, but, his personality is almost a polar opposite to the idea of a rampaging or violent being. Following down his arms and chest down one would spot the golden skin marking his arms around his elbows and the ornate channels over his body. Vibrant and stunning, the color seems to not be a tattoo or magic but how the troll’s skin is somehow naturally colored. Though, the golden luster shines unnaturally in darkness as well. Even those with an affinity to feel magic though cannot feel anything but faint traces of an ancient power lingering to the troll’s markings.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-TinyDinosaurSkeleton:512:256}\n\n{p:c}Continuing down along his body, Val’s legs are quite the powerhouses. Sculpted and firm, each leg is like a bent bow-limb, able to straighten to unleash a powerful force. A lifetime of hunting and running has toned the entire lower half of Valatl and the Zandalari packs some very powerful kicks. Agile and surprisingly nimble, one would have a hard time keeping up with or holding down a troll like Valatl if he wished freedom. Even at his ankles the troll has more of those pointed scales, making even a grazing kick from the Zandalari potential scratch and rend his foe’s flesh. Despite the natural weaponry though the Zandalari only resorts to violence if needed, often times preferring to enjoy the tranquil and peaceful life of hunting and the peace between hunts.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\Arch-Race-ZandalariBIG:256:512}\n\n{p:c}Would you know the Zandalari? If you embarked on the countless island expeditions during the Fourth War you may have been customers to Ahtlatl Outfitting. Run by a respectful and noble artisan who was a master of his many trades, Valatl was their assistant and resource supplier/gatherer. Though it seems there has been a change of ownership and now Valatl is the Chief Outfitter. Though sometimes it seems he forgets his new title. It also makes one wonder how he acquired it and why the business has been absent for quite some time now in Dazar'alor's port.{/p}\n\n",

Despite his meager upbringing and the savage nature of his kin, he was notably introverted and academic, choosing to stay at home penning the runic language of his people rather than hunt and brawl with the other younglings. This behavior earned the disdain of his peers, and they mockingly gave him the name \"Scratcher,\" after the incessant sounds of his writing. However, his efforts would soon pay off.\n\nAt a young age, Utok had mastered Orcish and made strides in astrology, a deeply venerated cultural practice among the Shadowmoon. This earned the admiration of the clan's mystics, and he became an apprentice shaman under Ner'zhul. Utok would use his newfound clout to compile the oral storytelling of his people into simple tomes, becoming one of (if not the) first Orc historians.\n\nScratcher's curiosity did not end at his territorial borders, however. Instead, he strove the travel the land, gathering history from the other orcish clans and even the Draenei. During this time he earned the respect of Orgrim Doomhammer, who valued his unique knowledge above the common brawn of his subordinates.\n\nThe Iron Horde:\n\nUtok was present for and recorded the events of the Throne of Kil'jaeden. However, his clan would remain fiercely independent of both the Legion and the rising Iron Horde. The young orc would continue gathering information as a neutral agent, but would send word of Grommash's utter subjugation of the once-great Gorian Empire to Ner'zhul. The Elder Shaman would remain defiant, but following a quick yet brutal show of force by the Warchief, he would ultimately pledge his cause to the Iron Horde. Threatened for his lack of fealty, Ner'zhul was pressured to draw upon the power of the Dark Star, a darkened Naaru that fell during the Draenei's descent from the Dark Beyond. Utok too would drink of this Naaru's power, and developed a taste for void energy.\n\nThe young shaman would soon after be called upon by Orgrim Doomhammer to be his chief advisor. Orgrim lead the Grom'kar, an elite army of orcs assembled from various clans to conquer the continent for their warchief. Utok would serve Orgrim for many campaigns against the less fortunate denizens of Draenor. Following the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth, he participated in opening skirmishes of the War of Iron, the Iron Horde's conquest of Blackrock Spire from the Dark Iron dwarves, but was called back to defend the Dark Portal along with the rest of the Grom'kar as the armies of the Alliance and Horde assaulted it. As defeat seemed inevitable, he and his men retreated back through the gateway and awaited orders on Draenor. ",

His many years of training is displayed by a clearly defined muscular frame, yet through it all, he's managed to maintain a large belly and all around chubby figure that any Pandaren should be proud to have. His gait would give contrast to his rather heavy appearance by showing that he's quite light and swift on his feet; the burly fellow's got a well-balanced stride, especially for one of his size.{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff} Underneath the somewhat worn and tattered armor usually adorning him is a frame of mostly brown, coarse fur and a hide so thick that it'd do a name like 'Bronzefur' more than enough justice. His chest, neck, his feet, and the tops of his paws are some exceptions to his fur color, always having been bright white of hue. A collection of scars could be seen on most parts of his body, though they'd likely seem to be primarily concentrated at his shoulders, arms, chest, gut, and upper back.{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff} Most would meet a narrowed and seemingly studious gaze when catching the attention of Chentao. Even so squinted, one could easily remark the forest green eyes hidden below that bushy brow of his. Though most of the fur on his face is rough and bristly, it'd seem to be absent of scars and lacerations. Similar to most of his kin, he has prominent ears, chubby cheeks, a wide jawline, a thick neck, and rounded facial features.

						["TX"] = "Madeline at a glance\nA petite young woman with long, dark smooth hair, rosy pale skin, and glowing amethyst eyes stands before you. This woman stands tall with excellent posture and walks with self-assurance and confidence. When she walks by or stands next to you, you might get a whiff of mandarins, coconuts, and vanilla. She can be seen wearing a dark blue, red, and green armor set with matching green goggles and a bronze hunting rifle with green bullets. \n\nMadeline’s Armor\nMadeline’s navy blue armor set primarily consists of mail materials. Her armor covers her body, but is form fitting -- showing off the filled out, and not so filled out parts of her body. Due to having an ectomorphic body type, Madeline is naturally a petite woman. She has narrow shoulders, and boney elbows and knees. The navy blue armor is decorated with red, light taupe, and green hues to accentuate her figure. This armor set is sleek and not flashy, as she wears it to be discreet. She is always carrying one of her weapons. She has a pair of matching 12 inch survival knives strapped to her left and right outer thighs and the bronze and oakwood hunting rifle with green bullets and grey wrappings. Under her armor, Madeline wears a black scoop neck leotard with black transparent tights and a set of black hand wraps. This second layer provides extra protection from all magic and extreme weather conditions.\n\nGadgets: \nMadeline has a hunting rifle made with bronze and oak wood and green bullets. \n On the outside of both of her thighs lie navy blue survival knives sheathed by matching leather cases.\nUnderneath her chest on on her ribs (on the green part of her chestguard), she has two block glocks that are holstered up via magnetism \nOn each side of her hip (green part of her belt) lays a pair of black metal spheres. Their purpose is unclear at a glance. \nThe green eyes on her wrists glow faintly, but its purpose is also unclear at a glance\nMadeline’s green goggles are large and simplistic in appearance and their purpose is also unclear at a glance\nThe diamond studs on her upper ears are bugged with microphones and the jade spheres on her lobe serve as the control panel for the studs. \nThe circular decor on the center of her chest looks like a projector lens, but its overall purpose is unclear at a glance. \nThe buckle on her belt protrudes outward slightly. It contains a grappling hook for climbing. \nThe soles of her boots have pocket knives attached to them. When activated, the blade of the knife can be seen from the tip. \nThe sleeve of Madeline's gloves have concealed, curved blades that extend up to three feet in length. They are activated at the push of a certain button.\n\nMadeline’s Face\nMadeline has a heart shaped face that is framed by her long, thick dark hair. Her elven ears are long and thin, sporting two studs on the upper portion of each ear -- blue and black diamonds. She also sports a small, jade spherical stud on each lobe. Her eyes are amethyst and glowing, round and large in shape, surrounded by long, thick lashes. She also has subtle dark circles under her eyes, an indicator of her lack of sleep. These dark circles, regardless of sleep quality, would still be present due to genetics, but are darkened via lack of sleep. They are subtle for the most part. Her cheeks are naturally rosy from discoloration with a slight pink tint, soft, and slightly chubby, making them pinchable and squishy. Her nose is small and straight, but upturns slightly at the very tip. Her cheeks and nose are sprinkled with several dozen pale freckles, that can be seen if one were to look closely at her face. Her lips, while not big or wide, are naturally plump, soft, and a pale shade of pink. They are smooth and in the right light, they glimmer, from some sort of lip balm. Behind her soft pink lips is a set of white teeth, but they are not pearly white like other elves, this is caused by drinking coffee, smoking, and eating sweets. They are mostly straight, but not perfect. She has vampire canines at the bottom and top part of her teeth, that are notably sharp, sharp enough to make someone bleed, should she bite them hard. \n\nMadeline’s Hair\nMadeline has long, thick dark hair that reaches down to her lower back, a few inches away from her buttocks. She wears her hair down her back, and some of it also falls in front of her chest. Her hair is predominantly black, but has a plethora of lowlights, highlights, and tones in charcoal, sliver, and black. Towards her scalp, Madeline sports black and ashy grey shades but her hair tones darken to richer charcoal and midnight black tones The very ends of her hair consist primarily of black and deep ashy tones. Her hair is for the most part straight, but becomes slightly wavy in texture toward the very ends. Her hair is soft, shiny, and smooth, with hardly any tangles or frizz. \n\nMadeline’s Body\nMadeline is a lanky, petite woman. While she may be small in stature, she is no stick. She has an “hourglass-ish” figure, but does not have perfect measurements, due to genetics and an uncompromised diet of delicious and nutritious foods… and a few sweets. Her bust is approximately 34 inches, with a 30 inch band size and she sports medium sized, perky D-cup breasts, which seem larger due to her petiteness. Her 24 inch waist is notably narrow compared to her 36 inch hips. Her arms and legs are toned, her arms more so than her legs, since she appears to store a large bulk of her fat in her thighs and buttocks. Her abs are not muscular, but they are flat. Her butt, while not large in size, is round, bubbly, and perked up from consistent, vigorous physical activity. She has matte black, sharp and short almond shaped nails. Each ring finger nail has a white cartoony skull painted on it. She has a black tongue piercing, several ear piercings, and piercings that hide beneath her layers. \n\n\n",

She stands just a few inches shy of seven feet tall and possesses a strong, powerful build from a lifetime of hard work and combat. At the age of eighteen the Tark’ri went through the trials to become a Wolfrider. She would narrowly survive the trials but in the end the young Warsong would make her ancestors proud by claiming that coveted title. She would ride amongst her fellow raiders as an equal and share in the glories of battle. \n\nSeveral years after Tark’ri established herself within the clan a mysterious orc showed up. He had the markings of the clan but nobody had seen him before. He warned them about the imminent doom of their people and the destruction of their planet. With this knowledge the orcish people would reject Gul’dan and his demonic masters, sparing both the orcs and Draenor a fate worse than death. Soon after the clans would come together to form the Iron Horde in order to conquer a new land which the stranger, who had come to be known as Garrosh, spoke of. It took many months to build the great portal but in the end the gateway was open and the Iron Horde charged through into the new world where they would meet the forces of Azeroth head on. \n\nTark’ri was amongst the initial wave that pushed through and alongside her brothers and sisters she cut her way through the forces of Azeroth, battling new and exotic enemies. All hopes of ‘glorious conquest’ were extinguished when the portal fell dark and Tark’ri and the others found themselves trapped on the strange new world without reinforcements. Those who weren’t killed were captured with Tark’ri amongst the latter. \n\nDuring the night her small encampment was set upon by Horde forces. After nearly an hour of combat the exhausted orc found herself surrounded with none of her comrades left alive. Refusing to back down, the Warsong let out a war cry and charged forth. She managed to take down eight of the remaining Horde soldiers before collapsing from her wounds. The ‘leader’ of the Horde party, a scheming little green rat, decided to take her back to Orgrimmar as a ‘prisoner of war.’ Once back in Orgrimmar, the Goblin would sell her off under the table to an arena master looking for quality prospects. The next two years of her life would be spent in chains, fighting in various arenas across Azeroth. During this time she would receive the name ‘Skullcleaver’ as the She-Beast took the heads of each of her fallen opponents. \n\nEventually the Warsong would manage to ‘claim’ her freedom but with no home to return to and no love for the people who robbed her of her pride, Tark’ri had very little prospects. The first few months as a free orc were spent swimming in ale and lashing out at anyone who looked at her in any way she deemed ‘funny.’ She was wallowing in self pity and hating the world around her and it wouldn’t be until she received one hell of a beat down from an elder green skin for her to snap out of it. She had one skill; fighting. She could put the past behind her and join the Warmachine but the aspect of that Banshee Bitch calling the shots outright killed that thought. Instead, The Skullcleaver returned to the arena to fight and earn a living to the roar of the crowds... {/col}\n\n",

His right eye was covered with a dark, rugged eyepatch, leaving his yellow left ever-the sentry. He always seemed to be watching, listening, waiting. His fur, a deep and dark gray mixing with black, was plush but not puffy, and covered the worgen thickly from head to toe. It kept him more than warm in cool weather, though he very much seemed to dislike the heat. Two simple braids adorned the fur where his jaw met his neck, always neatly braided and clean of any debris. \n\nThough most were generally covered with armor, his body was littered with many, many scars, the bulk of which on his torso and upper arms. His most immediately noticeable was, however, poking out vertically from his eyepatch-covered right eye. The pink scar had never healed correctly and it stood out against his dark fur. A few other noticeable scars were what appeared to be a poorly-healed but wide puncture wound just below his left shoulder, a worgen bite mark on his right, a deep cut on the underside of his left forearm, and thin pink scars wrapping all the way around both wrists.\n\nHis human form differed somewhat from the worgen though both were considerably taller than the average. His dark brown skin was similarly marred with scars and he maintained his intense and inhuman yellow gaze, fangs, and claws. Shoulder-length dreaded braids decorated his head, more often than not they were tied back neatly while he was working, which was very often.\n\nThough generally hidden beneath the armor he almost always had on, he forever wore two necklaces; one housing several silver rings far too small for his worgen fingers, and one holding onto what appeared to be a worg’s tooth made of similarly silver metals.\n\nAlthough generally slow when he walked, he moved with elegance and in smooth, directed motions. In either form, would smell faintly of pine sap, and those with acute noses would notice a faint trace of lilac. \n\nHis voice was gravelly and deep and he spoke with a sort of quiet intensity. It was rare he raised his voice.\n\nVC: Idris Elba\n\nHis animal forms are Kodiak Bear, Lion, Golden Eagle, Leopard Seal, and Percheron (Travel form).\n\nBear: 5'7\" (at the shoulder)\nCat: 4'10\" (at the shoulder)\nHorse: 6'8\" (at the withers) (20 hands)\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/Oh9NUBQ.jpg*Bear Form}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/HhJOiOK.png*Cat Form}\n{link*https://imgur.com/fE34oAH*Horse Form}\n{link*https://pestiluke.tumblr.com/post/613610035888668672/an-old-piece-of-my-main-wow-oc-in-his-human-form*Human Form}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/MQ4fGyt.png*Human Form (Formalwear/Full Body)}\n{link*https://pestiluke.tumblr.com/post/613256422549045248/finally-finished-my-reference-pic-of-worgen-form*Worgen Form}\n{/col}\n\n{h3}Personality{/h3}{col:688bff}\nTo most he is a grumpy but quiet man, and a displeased frown coats his face nearly always.

She knows nothing of her tauren herritage or customs. Extremely brash and harsh most of her life, she was a force to be reckoned with, even by her own cult. After a time, she became more and more aware of the destruction she truly caused with her fire, and the cataclysm opened her eyes fully to the truth. She defected, much to the dismay of her parents. She fled to the safety of the horde, where she was welcomed very hesitantly at first. She quickly proved her worth by aiding in the post-cataclysm effort to restore hyjal. She never saw her parents again, presumably because they fled into hiding when the majordomo was killed.{/p}\n\n{p:c}Lav now seeks to clear her name and reclaim the name she was given as a druid of the flame; The Burnt Horn, named for her blackened horns due to the flame magic she practices.

She uses either her staff or flaming daggers to conjure up the fire the bends.{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Appearance{/h2}\n\n{p:c}Lav sports a light brown coat that was formerly pure white at birth.

Her face is lacking much of the fur she used to have, especially her nose, which lacks it completely up to the middle of her snout. Across her body is a series of burn marks and scars, but much of it is covered by her armor. The only mark that remains exposed is one across her right thigh.{/p}\n\n{p:c}{icon:ability_mount_fireravengodmount:25}She is nearly always seen with a{icon:ability_mount_fireravengodmount:25}\nbird of some sort at her side, and is usually as firey in nature as she is.{/p}",

Underneath however, if shown, one could see that there was padding to keep himself safe during combat. He wore no shoulder guards with it, but he had gloves to protect his paws...with openings made into the leather to let his claws out. To finish it off, Dao almost always carried a pair of rapiers with him, and a belt with throwing knives on the sides.\n\nDao had two scars, one new, one old; a long slash from the top of his right shoulder, down to the middle of his arm.

Once the city fell, the aftermath left most of the survivors without the power of the Sunwell to sustain them. In this desperate time Asmodae turned to the Fel, submersing himself in it's addicting power. This gave him an insatiable appetite for even more power. A goal he found possible with a group known as the Illidari: those that follow Illidan. He trained, killed and did other unspeakable acts all in the name of the Illidari and gaining more power. With the fall of the Black Temple, Asmodae saw it as a lost cause and retreated to the Netherstorm. For the next few years he lost touch with reality and started to become more demon than elf. Eventually he would be found by the Shattered Sun Offensive and would nearly lose his life. They thought him a beast to be put down, his saving grace was that they noted he attacked only demons. They used him for a while clearing out demons that remained in the outlands and sheltered him bringing him back from the brink, having him relearn what he had lost. With the return of the Illidari during the Azeroth Legion invasion the Shattered Sun introduced him back to his homeland so that he may defend it. Even now he still struggles with even casual social engagements, and with no war currently, this is one of the more difficult periods of his life",

A few skulls that he kept as a trophy signifying the hunt but also his respect for them.  Even with that Kazrath would talk about the respect he had for his enemies. He believed that a true warrior should respect those whom he faces. \n\nRecently Kazrath had gone back to his winter home and had decided to tattoo himself.

Her first century was simple - help her mother and father tend to their ranch in between her studies, and whenever possible, spend time with the soldiers from Lordaeron and Quel'thalas if she could sneak away. For most of these hundred years, her intention was simply to take up the sword for her country, or if that didn't work, to take up a spade and hoe instead. She was a carefree, tomboyish child, and any thoughts of war were distant fantasies like storybook heroes. There were occasional scraps with the Amani trolls, certainly, and even the adventurous Witherbark hunting beyond their ken, but the thought that Sid Everlight may one day be a soldier never really crossed her mind.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-88:64:64}\n\n{col:ffd100}Sid first saw war of any kind around 75 BDP when the fledgling human kingdom of Stormwind went to war with the unified gnoll packs of Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Brightwood, and Redridge. Though it was a purely human conflict unaided by the seven kingdoms, an overly enthusiastic and idealistic young Sidaelea heard of this conflict and traveled for months to the south to lend her blade. Ultimately, she was only involved to a very minor extent, helping small human towns battle off Packlord Garfang's pack. Within a year, she was recalled to Quel'thalas and berated for involving herself needlessly in another nation's affairs.{/col}\n\n{h2:r}Entering the Priesthood{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{col:ffd100}Following the Gnoll War, Sidaelea returned briefly to her parents' ranch before entering into the service of the priesthood in Silvermoon City to learn proper discipline. She had always heard of the Holy Light growing up, and like all of her kind, revered the Sunwell as the source of their magic, life, and culture, but she didn't fully understand the depths of the Quel'dorei's religious beliefs. This would change drastically in the years to come, as she spent much of the coming decades amidst the clergy. For nearly a century, she existed solely where the Light and the Quel'dorei needed her - which for the most part meant the Isle of Quel'danas, tending to the Sunwell, or in Silvermoon proper as an aid to the people.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-priest-cover:256:256}\n\n{col:ffd100}During this tenure with the priesthood, Sidaelea maintained her skill with the blade through late-night practice sessions beyond her own walls. Many among the priesthood were known to be skilled in such a way, and often armed themselves as needed to defend Quel'thalas just as the Farstriders and city guards. Still, their primary function was prayer and relief - at least until the Third War, when Prince Arthas Menethil laid siege to Quel'thalas in 20 ADP and resurrected the necromancer Kel'thuzad as a lich using the waters of the Sunwell. During the invasion, Sidaelea and a select few other survivors on the Isle of Quel'Danas holed up in the hills beyond the Plateau, fighting off whatever undead came their way. After this incident, the faith of so many was shaken, Sidaelea's included. The Sin'dorei were born, named to honor the blood of the fallen.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}Becoming a Paladin{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{col:ffd100}Fifteen years prior to the fall of Quel'thalas, Sidaelea heard of the formation of the Order of the Silver Hand and the training of the first paladins. At the time, she thought nothing of it - but after losing almost 90% of the Quel'dorei, her people were attracted to the idea of holy warriors capable of fighting back against the undead Scourge. In those five years after Prince Arthas' attack, Sid donned her armor once more to aid the newborn Sin'dorei in reclaiming Quel'thalas. The progress, however, was excruciatingly slow, and with little to no direction, an extremely frustrated Sid followed Prince Kael'thas to Lordaeron.{/col}\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-Demons:512:256}\nSidaelea was there for the betrayal of Grand Marshal Garithos, just as she was there for Sunstrider's pact with Lady Vashj of the naga. She escaped the dungeons of Dalaran alongside so many others, and from there, crossed through the Dark Portal to the extradimensional wastes of Outland. Shortly thereafter, once Illidan had trained the Sin'dorei to extract magic from alternative sources, Sid followed Kael'thas to Northrend and aided in their fight, though her role was minor and never on the front lines. Still, this experience would sow the seeds of doubt that the Prince was capable of leading their people effectively while vengeance ruled his heart.\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-KaldoreiWindChimes:512:256}\nStill, when the Magisters proposed they create the Blood Knights using the sapped strength of the captive N'aaru M'uru, Sidaelea was there to take the oath. Now fueled by Illidan's teachings, a mana-addicted husk of her former devout self, she lusted for greater power. Anything, anything that would provide her some mode of destructive potential against the undead or any others who would oppose the Sin'dorei was well worth claiming - and it was with this mindset that she began to make a servant of the Light she once served herself.\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-BonesOfTransformation:512:256}\nIn those days and months that followed, Sidaelea did not return to Outland and was left unaware of their Prince's betrayal. She carried out the vengeance of the Sin'dorei in Quel'thalas once more, now armed with the broken Holy Light and the tutelage of their Matriarch, Liadrin. The Blood Knights carved a swath through the undead and eventually turned their sights upon the rest of the world's paladins, eventually burning down Alonsus Chapel to establish their own dominion over the Light. It was not until Kael'thas stole M'uru from the Blood Knight Headquarters in Silvermoon that their Order's eyes were opened, and behind Liadrin, Sid marched to Shattrath City in Outland to submit to the N'aaru A'dal.\n\n{h2}The Shattered Sun{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\nFollowing Kael'thas' betrayal, Sid followed the Blood Knights and A'dal in service of the Shattered Sun Offensive. For the better part of a year, she assisted in dismantling the traitor prince's operations in Netherstorm, and following his defeat in Tempest Keep, traveled to participate in the offensive on the Isle of Quel'Danas. Though she was not present for the actual battles with the fel-tainted Kael'thas or Kil'Jaeden, Sid participated in the siege of both to a minor extent. Her greatest involvement in the siege, however, was in the battle to retake Sun's Reach Harbor. It was here that she saw most active combat against the demons, and ultimately where she decided that she would always serve whatever unified fighting force stood against a larger threat.\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-demonhunter-cover:256:256}\nSidaelea remained on the Isle of Quel'Danas for several months after it was reclaimed, aiding in the Shattered Sun's relief efforts there to rebuild and restore the resting place of the Sunwell. Despite that recent promise to herself, she was grateful for the opportunity to trade out her blade for a hammer and nails for a change. Of course, in what felt like no time at all, she came to regret those thoughts; an old enemy returned, and Sid rushed off to the north.\n\n{h2:r}The Argent Crusade{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}",

Father was killed in a dispute over a water claim in te mountains north west of the city of Gadgerzan, His mother became a concubine for one of the underbosses who oversaw the cities water company. \n\nBy his late teens, having worked as a laborer for the same boss that routinely made use of his mother, he was taken in by the Steamwheelde as a goon.  He began to make his way though the ranks slowly, but in part it was a dual edge sword that guided him as one  he was allowed in cus of his mothers involvement be due to that also, he was used to keep his mother compliant to the boss's wishes and desires.\n\nYoung Adult and the Steamwheedle.\nHaving spent a several years being a Bruiser for the cartel, He finally learned fully how his mother was being treated. Now unable to touch the underboss who was abusing her (And serveral other women) he was how ever able to get into the Cartel via his size that impressed a made man in the group to bring him on as muscle. That is when friction began when his mothers \"boss\" learned he had joined another  mans crew. Meaning he was semi protected from being used against his mother.  After a few more years learning the trade, and serving as a Bruiser for both the cartel and city as a whole his size and skill increased more and more.  During the anniversary of Gadgetzan celebration, his mother watched as her boss, in a drunken rant. began to slap around his \"Ungrateful slut\" and degrading her and her son who, with his own boss and crew near by, Heard this and before anyone could stop him, he defended his mother, by killing her attacker.  Once the uproar was brought into control, He and is mother were hauled in, One crew screaming for his death, his own defending him citing the behavior of the murdered boss as proof the actions were due to Family loyalty.  Surprisingly, the new made boss of that crew defended him also, (particially cus he wanted the promotion and couldnt figure how to do it).  Boss Noggenfogger ruled on it citing the uncooth behavior of one o his underbosses was not tolorated and he granted favor to Karrik and let him stay within the organization.\n\nMother and Unmade.\nHaving narrowly escaped being put down for his defense of his mother, Karrik continued his work with his crew, working in Shimmering flats as laborer and guard. His mother had moved north to the port town of Rachet to start over, more so to avoid any other trouble for her son.  Now rumors began to surface from his crew that he was to be kept as a muscle goon.  No chance to move higher within the cartel, all fingers pointed to his killing of his mothers former master.  He, on his part was not to phased.  His enjoyment of being a goon and having some freedom from the rules that governed the cartel, his attitude toward not being able to become part of the cartel proper was mellow.  He did his job and enjoye perks of it. Be them parties, more coin, and the ladies. Ladies by far he came to know working in the desert city and its out laying business'. Enjoying a life of travel and other based delights town to town, it was in Ratchet that he witness the passing of the Horde, having just arrived and aided the Tauren tribes of the barrens he had heard of them being aided by goblins in their war against the Kolkar Centaur. \n\nComing of the Horde\nA year after the Orcs and their allies traveled north into Ashenvale, rumors came south out of the red hills (Now Durotar) of the quillboar tribes being routed out and driven into the southern barrens. Fighting said tribes from attempting to invade Ratchet he was there when the Horde came to aide them.  Intruged by these orcs and Trolls and Tauren, the goblins of ratchet immediately spoke of their city far to the south and setting up trade rights and business contacts. Karrik was one of the first to volunteer to travel to the new city of Ogrimmar to guard the trade envoys in this new  settlement.\n(More to come)",

His looks is unkempt, especially his mane. In a rare occassion he is seen groomed well with a flamboyant mohawk. His face looks stern, but is actually sweet and rambunctious in heart. He has a nosering, and two more gold earrings on his left ear. He could make up a smug if you try to get his attention, and if he likes you. His body is sturdy, balanced and muscular with a bellygut. He has piercing on his chest nipples as well as some scars on his torso from accidental forgework. One could feel his firmness and the warmth if you try to feel his body. He loves eating and drinking, working out and also hammering his weapons by the anvil of his forge, and he's not afraid to show you how strong and attractive he is with that male body of his. Beneath his body lies a crushing thighs between his legs, and a nice pair of hooves to stomp around with. He makes sure he doesn't skip leg days. Sometimes.\n\nRoarmulus lives by his family name of Flintstone. His herritage branches onwards, and up to him that the blacksmith work has been going for years and on. It is easy to remember how he forged the weapons for all tribes of Highmountain. During the Burning Legion Invasion, the requisition of his wares surged in priority for the battle against them, and he tries to keep in pace to get everyone armed against his people's enemies. It was a rough time during then, and now his work subsides, but peace came short when the Horde reaches out for the Highmountain. He is packed on his work, and it is difficult for him to ship his wares over to Orgrimmar, so he had no choice but to move there, despite the political business he's facing. He did what he could for the war, and when it came to an end, he relaxed for a little in the town, and sets his next move to venture across the world of Azeroth.\n\nRowdy moose bull he is, he can be very boisterous and loud, and could drink like a bottomless drunkard on the taverns. He usually is a chaotic type that can cause any trouble when he overdrank. Outside of it, he can be nice if you get onto his good side. At home, he has two poultries pets he lives with and feeds them whenever he's around. Thankfully, his tribefolk are very nice and takes care of them.\n\nThe heart of the forge lives with him, so long as he walks, it burns bright.{/col}{/p}\n\n{p:c}{link*https://imgur.com/a/DkoQ60s*Flint portrait, rough sketch @ me}{/p}",

He remained within Draenor until the year Ner'zul thought to reopen the portal to other realms (circa Though the Dark Portal) joining his father in the small incursions with the Warsong into Azeroth, when the alliance counter attacked he was taken hostage  and held, as an oddity as he was NOT green as many other orcs. After the defeat of second invasion and destruction of Draenor into  Outlands, he was taken and thrown into one of the many Intermentcamps the humans made to hold those orcs they captured.\n\nSeeing this youth had energy and  spirit the humans of his camp soon used him as physical labor.  As he grew a day came he was sent to the forge to work the bellows. There his body took on its muscled girth common to orcs, the forge production doubled with his help.  Soon the forge master gave the youth a chance at the anvil.  First it was merely ingots and horse shoes and nails the youth pounded out.  Then the forge master took kindly to the orc and began showing him how to forge Armor only. Soon the Orc was skilled at ring mail then soon forging breastplates.  The Forge master kept him to armor only as it was frowned on to teach the ENEMY how to forge weapons. As the youth grew he snuck about watching training, and guards of the camp engaging in practice, he attempted to practice his own skill at arms. Jokingly some guards found this out and decided to use him as a test dummy for younger troops to deal with the Larger Orc, preparing fpr dealing with a Orc clan uprising in the Altrec mountains.  \n\n                ~~~~~~~Coming of Thrall And the New Horde~~~~~~\n\nOne day the youth met a green skin orc hear his age, a recent captured orc who began speaking to the orcs of the camp. Listening to this empassioned Orc and seeing his skill of the  element.  Opening the forge to this orc and those who roused to the call to escape he joined Thrall and orcs of the camp to break out and flee into the mountains to join with the Warsong and Frostwolf clans. Joining this new horde he was trained as much as he could be but soon his skill as a smith were seen and he did what he could to aid the horde, even going so far as repairing Thralls armor at times.  Soon the Horde made its exodus to Kalimdor, following Thrall and Grom Hellscream.  Fighting with his people though the Barrens and Ashenvale and surviving the battle of My Hyjal.  As the dust settled from the Third war, the Youth looked out on a new land and new life.\n\n         ~~~~~~~~~~The Establishing of Durotar and Kalimdor~~~~~~~~~\n\nIn the aftermath of the War with the scourge and legion, surviving his wounds, the Young warrior traveled with the Horde to establish the city of Orgrimmar, as the city was established, he traveled with Orcs into the barrens to help establish and maintain a trade route between Orgrimmar and new Tauren settlement of Thunder Bluff in Mulgore.  During this he aided those who wished to settle in the new town of the cross roadsbuild their homes.  This lead to the first and not the last time battles with both Quilboars, who were driven out of Durotar, and the Kolkar tribes, who were still out for blood when the horde first came though the barrens and aided the Tauren.  The first battle of such culminated in a joint attack by both Quilboars and Kolkar  on the new town of Crossroads, here the Young warrior aided and for a time took charge of the defense of the town.  With the arrival of troops from Orgrimmar to break the attack Cross roads was saved from sacking.  Seen by those as a warrior worth his skill, he was given rank with the Horde's military soon he was seen in many a place though out Kalimdor. Witnessed the establishment of ThunderBluff, Orgrimmar and Taujaro, Stood with the ranks that battled and repeled the invasion of Admiral Proudmoore's fleet of Durotar. It was during this that he caught the eye of commander Keithoo, a subcommander of the Kor Kron Elite, the recently established Guard of The Warchief.\n\n                 ~~~~~~~~~~Rising though the ranks~~~~~~~~~~\n(Time begins at time of Vanilla drop)\n\nOver the brif years following the Proudmoore invasion attempt, he served in Orgrimmar and surrounding settlements routinely. Aiding in defending Horde lands from the ever present Kolkar and Quilboar raiders.  With the joining of the Forsaken to the ranks of the Horde, he was hesitant to travel back to the eastern kingdoms, as much for lack of trust in the Scourge rejects, as for tangling with Alliance forces.  With the arising of the Dragonkin Onyxia and Nefarian in their attempts against both Horde and Alliance, he adventured though the lands doing what he could to aide his allies.  Just as these settled and a small peace would be seen, word came that the Blood Elves of Silvermoon had not only been granted addition to the horde but also though the actions of Kael'thas, opened the portal and such brought rumor of surviving lands of the once mighty world of Draenor.\n\nWith this news, the Warrior joined, with partial invitation from Thrall himself, who recalled the brown orc from the camps, the force sent though the portal to investigate the going ons of both the alliance and the Blood Elves.  Rejoicing in seeing the lands of his birth still thrived he eagerly took part in many of the Hordes actions within Outlands. It was during this that the warrior was given honor. The warrior was amongst the first to reach Nagrand and discover the Mag'Har village of Garadar and the presence of both the Great mother Geyah and Garrosh Hellscream.  At once he raced back to the portal and back to Orgrimmar, and brought forth by Commander Keithoo. He reported his findings to Thrall.  With all this Warrior had done since the camps and praised by many of the Grunts and commanders in the field, Thrall honored the Warrior with the chance to join the Kor Krom Elite.  Donning the Black and Gold, he returned to Outland as part of Thrall's guard as he went to visit The great mother and son of his closest friend.  With the defeat of Illidan and Kil Jaden in outland, the Horde returned to Azeroth. As things settled rumors came, via Jaina Proudmore and other contacts in Eastern Kingdoms, that a disturbance had begun in the far north.... \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Lich King to present time~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Invasion of the scourge back into the lands of the Horde and Allaince took many by surprise at the suddeness along with the precision strikes at most of the capitol cities in an attempt to slay the current rulers.  The warrior rose quick with the rest of the KKE and defended Orgrimmar and the Warchief from the undead invasions.  With the knowledge that the Lich King was one again arisen and planned to again take the world by storm, The warrior was given command of a small troop and dispatched with the larger force under comand of both Garrosh and Saurfang to counter the Scourge in Northrend.  Arriving in Northrend, the War against the Lich King began.\n                            \nServing within this elite corps, he took to the fields of Northrend,  Fighting though Northrend as sub commander to the newly promoted, Warlord Kiethoo (PC), he fought though most of Northrend securing foot holds for the invasion of Ice Crown, he nearly died when he and his team were caught in the attack on Wrathgate. Watched in horror as the forsaken betrayed the Horde and Alliance with their massive attempt to use poison and blight to kill all in sundry.\n\n  Surviving the Betrayal at the Wrathgate and the final assaults on Icecrown, he returned to Kalimdor and for a time took leave of the Elite and traveled the land as more of a mercenary. With the advent of the Cataclsym, and Deathwinds return, he once more took up the Black and Gold to aide in rebuilding and containing the heighten threats between Horde and Alliance.  At first delighted with the appointment of Garrosh to Warchief, he soon saw this was a change, as the Kor Kron of old was sent on increasingly dangerous missions and a new corps of Kor Kron was being raised with each death of Original KKE.  After the defeat of Deathwing, came the discovery of Pandaria, here the tensions Grew between those of KKE as Chuk, and others, noticed and even endured the  outright hostilities between the Old and New guard. Though out this he still served the Warchief hoping it was merely misunderstanding..  Then came the cull.  \n\nThe Cull (RP events in Orgrimmar undertaken by Orcs RPing as Kor Kron)\n\nGarrosh's plans and ideas became zealotous with his followers, and New Kor Kron and the old Elite began clashing in the streets of Orgrimmar.  Those left of the Old Guard, attempted to dethrone Garrosh after his plans in Pandaria became known and with his many deeds to divide the Horde races.  This Failed.  Many old Kor Kron Elite were slain out right and chased and fought though the city.  Several of the Black and Gold's were captured, Chuk himself but due to a lack wit of a warrior guarding him, escaped and succeeded in rescuing several Black/golds before they were taken south and exicuted.  The next few months, leading up to the Siege of Orgrimmar, the surviving Black/golds lead small missions though out Kalimdor showing that not all Kor Kron were now murderers and wholely devoted to Garrosh.   Participating in the Siege, Chuk'Atrok was not amongst the lead elements to defeat Garrosh, he had continued with the fighting in the City proper.\n\nReturning Home.....Sort of?\n\nSince the end of the Siege, he has taken to a mercenaries life again, unable to wear his Black and Gold, even in memory of what was, would lead to him being attacked.  Still serving the Horde he learned of a new threat beginning, the portal had opened again and this time, militarized Orcs, Brown of skin had invaded though the portal.  Not knowing first hand of what happened after the fall of Garrosh, he was surprised to learn this invasion was from.....Draenor?\n\nHurriedly he joined the Horde in its counterattack and beheld the Land of his birth As they were before the legion, though these lands were also changed as these orcs were mobilized in a new Horde but one lead by orcs not the Legion.  Seized by both joy, curiousity and abject lust to see his homeland as it had been, he took to the campaign against the Iron Horde. At first he was hesitant in his actions, but soon though the ordeal things came to light to show the under side of the story and again the Legion at work. Renewed effort to aide both Horde and Frostwolf clan to stop the  Ironhorde, and make them see the threat of Gul'Dan (Again) he aided in the downfall of Gul'dans plans.  Sadly a choice was made as he had strong ties to the Draenor that was and this altered Draenor that could be.  He chose to leave and return to Azeroth.  These events led into the resurgance of the Legion In Azeroth... the cycle continued....\n\n\n\n\n\n",

					["TX"] = " {h2}Physical Description{/h2}\nElinore is a young woman of average height and looks to be in her early twenties. Typical of most women, her nose is slender and jawline is soft, tapering downwards to a delicate chin. The corners of her lips are a little upturned, making it seem like she's always smiling faintly. She has large round eyes in a light turqoise hue and they're framed by long, curled lashes and slightly arched brows. Ellie is not one for heavy make-up, other than on rare, special occasions. She's usually found fresh-faced, only opting for brown mascara to define her lashes and some tinted gloss for her lips, with colors ranging from warm pinks to soft corals. Her hair color is a rich honey-blonde, with strawbery blonde undertones and highlights mixed in. It hangs mid-way down her back where the bottom half is naturally a bit wavy. As for her build, she looks fit and slim, but not overly thin.\n\nHer features are quite expressive, therefore it's rather easy to tell her mood. However, with effort, she is capable of concealing her feelings and conjuring up a neutral visage.\n\nHer attire is indicative of a fortunate upbringing, but her gait and posture, while graceful, lack the rigidity of noble birth. She appears to be someone who's quite relaxed and easy-going. Hints of an extremely slight Gilnean accent surface at odd times when she speaks, and this heritage is also glimpsed in her features.\n\n({link*https://imgur.com/a/k3LeyTo*This} is what Elinore looks like!)\n\n\n{h2}Other Details{/h2}\n{icon:inv_trinket_80_kultiras02b:25} Bracelet-Watch\nIt's mostly a bracelet with a small, delicate clock face in the center. If you pay close attention, you'll notice she has many of these, all done in different metals, with the bezel of the clock face done in different gemstones (specifically the 12 birthstones). They almost always match whatever outfit she wears. \n\n{icon:inv_jewelry_necklace_64:25} Oval Turquoise Necklace\nA naturally shaped oval turquoise pendant dangles from a delicate truesilver chain. The semi-precious stone is framed with a thin, but elegant silver bezel. The gem itself is a vibrant hue with thin gold veins running through it, and it matches the color of her eyes nicely. This piece is not used to match outfits, and is usually tucked underneath collars. It is also sometimes layered with other pieces. {link*https://imgur.com/a/mXY3nRa*Picture of the Gem!}\n\n{icon:ability_ghoulfrenzy:25} Faint Scar\nIf she's wearing short-sleeves and you have a good eye, you can see on the inside of her left forearm are two very thin and faint parallel scars, about 3 inches long. They're barely noticeable at a glance, but are visible upon close inspection.\n\n\n{h2}OOC Information{/h2}\nPersonality traits and other details have been left out of this profile on purpose. Please come roleplay to find out more! =)\n\nI use the Musician addon and its Piano plugin for Einore's piano playing. If you'd like to hear the music, you will need the addon and the plugin.\n\nDisclaimer: All credit for the songs Elinore plays in-character goes to their original composers, as well as the musicians who arranged the scores.",

Several have blended into his fur over time, but are still noticable up close. \n\nMost prominently, a scar runs across his muzzle diagonally, with another barely visible on his left cheek. Several more scars mark his chest and arms. Two scars on opposite sides of his stomach show where he has obviously been run through with a sword, though this is normally covered by his robe.\n\n\n{col:ff0000}Clothing{/col}\n\nCeadrith is dressed sparingly in a simple robe of leather and cloth. Interwoven in the fabric of his robe are all manner of talisman and fetish of animal bone and feather. Every feather and piece of bone is from an animal found in the Barrens. Additionally, Ceadrith wears no worked metals of any kind on his person.\n\n\n",

Making his way into Azshara to the coastline for some salty ocean air he noticed up the beach a campsite. Giving in to his terrible habits he ran up to the camp to rummage whatever goodies he could find.\n  \n Out of the ocean came a naga witch grabbing him by the throat with her magic. \"ssso you come to take my trinketssss have you\" she cackled. He grabbed at the arcane tendrils wrapping around his throat but his paws passed through them. The seawitch cackled slamming him to the ground. \"I think I know a proper punissshment for you\" as she enveloped him in a green toxic mist. He felt faint never experiencing this type of magic before. He collapsed to the ground choking.\n       \nPickles woke up hours later looking around, the tide moved in and the seawitch and her camp were gone. He stood up confused looking down at himself... or herself? \"what did she do to me?\" Pickles yammered. Walking over to the water he looked down at his reflection, or.... her reflection. \"I.... i'm changed?\" she stared confused and angry. \"That cursed sea witch changed me into a vixen!\" She took a few moments to stare out at the ocean eager to catch the seawitch, but all she heard was her cackling off in the distance.\n\nShe made her way back to Orgrimmar, unsure of what others would think of the change. She didn't overly mind it though as she kept looking at her reflection. \"looks good honestly.\" she sighed, \"gonna be a shame to have to go back\"\n                                      {icon:spell_misc_zandalari_council_soulswap:25}",

Vrothenar carries these ideals with him in as much as he is able...though there was one time in his life where his Feral nature got the better of him. \n\nEarly life was as any other Frostwolf...hunt, eat, sleep, repeat. Mother and father were proud members of the clan...strong and generous. It had been only years after his birth hat this orc was killing game that even more elder hunters would hesitate to pursue. \n\nTragedy would strike without mercy as the boy witnessed his father and mother beaten to death by ogres his mother having almost been raped if it were not for the actions of his father. When their broken bodies laid before him, he remembered precious little of what transpired. All Vroth knew is that when he finally came to he stood in the center of a massacre...the small raid of Ogres having been slain by ferocious methods...throats torn out by his teeth which then dripped blood and soured his tongue with the filthy life essence of those who stole his life from him. \n\nAfter being found by a regularly visiting family, Vrothenar was taken to a nearby village where he was then adopted by the Elder. Over the years he would learn more of what it meant to be Frostwolf and the ideals passed along from one generation to the next...the responsibilities and the undaunted vigilance of protecting family and clan. \n\nHe grew and his skill followed in tandem in fact as he managed to grasp at the attention of one of the Warsong...a commander who held close ties to a few Frostwolf homes including the elder that took him in. Seeing that he honestly had taught the man everything he could...the Elder granted a blessing to Vrothenar to train under the Warsong...to expand upon the ferocity that slain the ogres so long ago.\n\nDays turned to months turned to years all within the span of what seemed like minutes to the Frostwolf. Trained to wield an ax with the strength that resembled Chieftains of old. When properly trained to the standards of the Warsong, the Frostwolf warrior would join them on raids against the ogres as well as rushed defenses of villages and through this the orc gained trust which was rewarded with an ax of the Warsong which screamed as most of their weaponry did when swung. \n\nAfter this the Frostwolf would find himself confronted with a living member of what he thought to be a dead lineage. His uncle...a powerful shaman with abilities gained from a lifetime of dedication to the elements would confront him and through him was given yet another gift. His ax which was masterfully crafted was then imbued with the power of Spirit. A fifth element that grants him the strength to hew through even the toughest of armors with a seemingly minuscule amount of effort. \n\ntbc\n\n\n",

He is average height and weight for a muscular built Sin'dorei. Unlike most of his Illidari kin, Mal does not sport any of the usual signs of demonic corruption aside from his eyes, which overflow with Fel energy. His chest is adorned with vibrant red tattoos that were placed during his binding ritual. Upon close examination, the tattoos appear to be a flowing river of energy.\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/wqbwARd*Art}\n{col:ababab}{/col}\n\nBound to Malanguine is a Doomguard by the name of Vo'zurth. As a result of this binding, Mal is granted immense physical strength and an otherwordly tolerance for pain. When transformed, his skin becomes covered in rigid scales and two pointed horns sprout from his head. \n\n{link*https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/20/1e/aa201eeeb9616f1255432fde17ca6527.jpg*Demon Form Reference Art}\n{col:ababab}(Not my art, if you know the artist, let me know so I can credit){/col}\n{/col}{/p}\n\n{h3:c}{icon:ability_demonhunter_eyebeam:25}{col:c65d39} Personality {/col}{icon:spell_shadow_demonform:25}{/h3}\n\n{p:c}{col:c1a635}Malanguine is a friendly individual, though sometimes that manifests itself in the form of sarcasm. While not the smartest person around, there is very little that Mal wouldn't do to help a friend. Always the first to leap in to the fray and the last to leave it, Mal is never one to shy away from conflict. That being said, he will actively try to keep his friends and allies out of harms reach if he can help it. Every hit he takes is one his allies dont have to.{/p}\n\n{h3:c}{icon:inv_misc_tournaments_symbol_bloodelf:25}{col:c65d39} History {/col}{icon:crest_demonhunter:25}{/h3}\n\n{p:c}{col:c1a635}Malanguine spent a large portion of his life as a farmer. There was nothing extraordinary about his life, as he minded his business and rarely partook in gossip. It took a Legion raiding party destroying everything to shake things up. The raid was led by Vo'zurth, who took great pleasure in murdering Malanguine's wife in front of him, then leaving the broken man to pick up the pieces. Equipping himself with what he could and rallying other farmers who had been ravaged, he led a mob to strike back at those who took everything from him. He personally sought out the doomguard and fought him, giving every ounce of energy he had to strike down the beast. Making sure not to finish him off, he dragged the bound demon across the land until he had found a group of Illidari. Marching in to their camp and demanding to join their ranks. His only condition was he wanted to be bound to Vo'zurth or die trying.\n\nThe process was far from easy. It took three full days for Mal to completely dominate the demon and bind him, however through pure strength of will, he managed to do it with minimal corruption. Following through on his oath to the Illidari, Mal followed them in to the fight, often making his way to the front lines and clashing face to face with the Burning Legion. He fought with reckless abandon, volunteering for missions most deemed suicide. He spent much of his time during the war working with a squad developed purely to hold the line while others retreated.\n\nAfter dealing with a harrowing experience in the Shadowlands, Mal is left trying to make sense of his life. Many of the truths he had taken for granted have been exposed as lies and coming to terms with that is no easy feat. The best he can do is take it one day at a time and choose who he trusts with great care.\n{/p}",

Righteous and just, this devout follower of the Light encompasses the very core of what it means to be a protector. To give without a thought, she shines with a reserved benevolence. To face her in battle, she is a composed structure of war, bent on defeating those whose cause is truly lost. No truth may hide from the divine matriarch, for she sees all with the Light as her guide. \n\nCoalesced light creates a dense nimbus around the woman's head, highlighting her features and making her presence immediately known. The light bathes her face in heavenly rays, revealing sacredly scarred tissue of a woman built from a lifetime of war. Citrine locks pool against pauldroned shoulders. Delicate ringlets curl around a mature visage, framing her marred cheeks and occasionally falling into her line of sight. Diverse shades of silver course throughout the gemstone thicket, catching the light every now and again. The petals of her pallid lips curl into a weary smile; rarely ever enough to show her teeth. Jadefire light illuminates the pointed features of her face, originating from her eyes. Beneath them, the lilac crescents of isomnia accentuate the tender flesh. The tell signs of age wear at the woman; warranting her natural beauty unworthy. \n\nShe is a woman of boisterous curves and bountiful musculature. A pristine set of plate armor adorns her brutish figure. Rarely ever is she seen out of warmetal.  A pair of hardened gloves conceal her calloused and scarred palms. Her muscular thighs are contained by seemingly indestructable legguards. Bulky clompers snake up her wiry calves, and hitch up to her knees; a vague incline is present in her soles. An austere hammer or shield and sword are often casually slung against her back. \n\nHycindel's voice is a sultry, Thalassian  croon. The raucous melody of her voice carries a refined arrogance. Her accent, though slight, is a plague upon her rich vocabulary, rendering her unable to pronounce complex syllables.{/col}\n{/p}\n",

When he came of age, Kark was put under the tutelage of a Farseer named Krel'noz who became the boy's guardian after the tragic death of his mother and older brother. Together the two shamans fought tusk and nail in the battles for Alterac Valley. Over the time fighting agaisnt the Stormpike Dwarves, and the Alliance, Kark has grew a deep and passionate hatred for the Dwarves and the Humans for the deaths of his mother and the gruesome torture they inflicted onto his older brother who he found the broken corpse with his fingernails torn off and a letter stabbed through the skull with the name of the Dwarf who executed him.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-bc-Nagrand:512:256}\n{h1:c}{col:5e821a}The Winds of the Ancestors{/col}{/h1}\n{col:5e821a}In the coming years, Kark and his mentor Krel'noz traveled through the Dark Portal once word pass that adventurers reestablish contact with the Mag'har who found refuge in Nagrand.

In the following days, Kark, learned more of his people's history and their past connection to the elements of Draenor. He gradually grew to feel a stronger familiar connection to the shattered remains of Draenor than he had for Azeroth. Although he secretly long to stay in Outland he knew that it was a dying world and together, him, Krel'noz and his granddaughter returned to Azeroth.{/col}\n\n{h1:c}{col:2c03ae}The Shadow Wolf Cowl\n“Under the shadow of the moon, the black wolf howls.”{/col}{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-Draenor:256:256}\n{p:c}{icon:achievement_boss_korkrondarkshaman:25}{col:2c03ae}The Shadow Wolf Cowl is a ancient shamanistic artifact made from one of the first few Shadowmoon shamans, Gar'gram Shadowhowl. Legend says that Gar'gram infused the cowl with the primal elemental energies of Draenor and empowers its wearer with a boost of its power as well strengthens their connection to the elements. However such claims can be nothing more but myths and legends.  Over the following generations, the Shadow Wolf has been passed down father to son after their passage into adulthood and complete their shamanistic training. For over a thousand generations, the Shadow Wolf has been used as a tool of balance and knowledge, as well a means of power. However Dar'kash, Son of Karn'kosh Shadowhowl, was given the cowl by his father and used his power to enslave the elements of Draenor for his own means. Dar'kash was eventually hunted down and nearly killed by his own clansmen and left behind the cowl. Karn'kosh would then hide away the cowl as he believes it has become a symbol of disgrace to his family's long and noble legacy, until word has passed of the bastard son of Drak'kash, a young Orc shaman who lives within the Frostwolf clan. When Kark ventured out to Outland with his mentor, the young shaman finally met his long lost grandfather. Once there, Karn'kosh retrieved Shadow Wolf from its container and handed it over to Kar'kash stating that he has redeemed their family's name by killing the one who spat on it, but it is up to Kar'kash and his legacy to restore the cowl's honor from all of the crimes it was forced to commit when it was worn by the Dark Shaman.  \n{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:860900}Bludgeon: The Dwarf Scalper{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{icon:inv_axe_1h_warfrontshorde_c_01:25}{col:860900}Forged from the minerals found in the Alterac Mountains, Bludgeon is a one of a kind weapon design to be as light as possible but sharp enough to slice through rock with ease. This weapon was used by a Frostwolf scout named Gra'tor who used it to slice off the heads of many Dwarves and clashed blades with many weapons of Alliance soldiers. The weapon gradually gained popularity by the Frostwolves who battled the stormpike dwarves that was given its own title; “The Dwarf Scalper”. While the weapon is taken care of well with the day to day sharpening and cleaning, there is a fine red line that is purposely left stain with the blood of its fallen enemies as a subtle but foreboding warning to never challenge its wielder in a combat to the death.{/p}{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-horde-CallOfTheStorm:256:128}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n{h1:c}{link*https://tinyurl.com/Kark-KollugArt*Artwork:Brotherhood}\n\n{link*http://fav.me/ddjmhth*Artwork:The Shadow Wolf}\n\n{link*http://tiny.cc/Themesong*Theme Song}\n\n{link*https://youtu.be/kwfuKv_C-is*Voice claim-Steve Blume}{/h1}\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n-I take my RP fairly serious in public and in cities (Although I might goof around in public OOC from time to time) and if I am being trolled by someone who's fooling around too much I will ignore them.

Be it through a silver tongue or a razor sharp wit, every situation could be controlled if approached correctly. All one needed was the right attitude and a penchant for using the assets one was given. While standing at a modest 6'1\" James would appear in every way the sly roguish gentleman. Keeping  himself well groomed at all times, that long black hair and matching beard were kept in nothing less than tip top shape. The same of course could always be said for any chosen attire. Be it a long colorful coat or those simple day to day threads, he would dress to impress. Or perhaps at the very least, dress to deceive.

The ying to the yang as one might say. While perhaps not as controlled and cialculating as his counterpart, there was something to be said for sheer animal instinct. While of course that sharp mind remained intact within this secondary form, something much more primal lurked within. The man of modest height now consumed, replaced at it were with a beast standing now a full 8'5\". That dark midnight hair converted into a full coat of rich dark fur. The ebon layer covering the mighty monster from that massive head down to those imposing paws. Seemingly with claws and fangs sharpened and at the ready, the most clever of plans were simply no longer needed. It was enough to relyon sheer brute force, and be gone with that sharp tongue in favor of a more direct and passionate approach. A methodical and calculating gaze now akin to something a bit more predatory.\n \n\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-42:64:64}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:828282}\"Do you feel free?

He cut his way through countless innocents, drank the demon's blood and went through the dark portal. Throughout the first and second war he was an unstoppable whirlwind of death cleaving through anyway that would get in the way, until he was captured and like many orcs placed in an internment camp. His onslaught could not be tamed though as he eventually broke free from the camp. When Thrall made the call to go west, he followed. After a few stops,the orcs as we all know arrived in Kalimdor. He followed with Grommash as they were both Warsong. He along with Grommash attacked the human base against thrall's orders. He followed Grommash to Ashenvale. He battled against the night elves with fury and once more drank the demon's blood along with Grommash and the rest. He and Grommash were eventually stopped, but his rage persisted. He continued with his relentless onslaught whether it was in outland slaughtering demons, in northrend cleaving through scourge, or more alliance. He was glad to see Hellscream become warchief and loyally served him throughout the battles against the alliance. He eventually with many other orcs arrived in Pandaria. One time, he got into a battle with some alliance soldiers. It was a difficult battle, and he had to use all the fury within him to slay the opposing warriors. After the battle was done, he was in such a state of rage and bloodlust, that he started just swinging randomly in the air trying to hit rage induced hallucinations. No matter how much he swung he could not hit them as they were not real. His anger consumed him and the sha took hold of him. His fellow soldiers tried to calm him down, but he just cut through them all. Eventually a pandaren monk came along and was to stop him. The monk said that he had let his anger consume him and that he must stop before his anger consumes the land. The orc did not budge though saying he had no care for the pandaren's land. To that the pandaren pointed to the corpses of his fellow soldiers and asked him if he at least had some care for his fellow soldiers. The orc kneeled to the ground and weeped. In that moment he realized that his rage and hatred was not justified. He begged the pandaren monk to train him to contain his rage and the pandaren accepted. Over time Grom'loktar stopped being such a warmongering and psychotic orc and instead became a calm and caring one. He realized that Garrosh was leading the horde down a path of bloodlust and blind rage, so he quit the army and returned home. He later participated in the siege of Orgrimmar. He helped fight the legion on the broken shore. After Vol'jin died and Sylvanas became the new warchief, he was not happy. Her warlike attitudes and blatant disregard for honor being the main two reasons. He did not participate in the fourth war, as he had realized how pointless the alliance vs horde war was. He was eager to overthrow and he arrived at Orgrimmar along with Varok Saurfang and the others. He witnessed the duel, and was saddened by Saurfang's death. Though he was somewhat happy that Sylvanas would no longer be warchief. \n",

Rather than groom it too much, they bind it in a loose braid that they leave hanging either to the side or pushes it over their shoulder.\n\n•Because of the above, it is comically easy to confuse Kai for a she-orc.\n\n•Like many Frostwolves, Kai’s eyes are clear blue. They tend to rebuke the claim that it is symbolic of a greater destiny, preferring not to think of themself as anything more than an archer and caretaker to their pack.\n\n•Also white as snow is the war paint they wear on their face, namely the camouflage-like streaks against their mag’har brown skin. They also seem to have the snarling wolf head emblem of the Frostwolves tattooed on their right pec and a white hand tattooed on the outside of their left arm. As of late, they sport a searing brand on the lower part of their stomach; which they aren’t shy to show off, sporting a mail-midriff.\n\n•Kai’s ears are gauged with inch wide iron plugs and their septum bears an iron loop. Although not a cosmetic choice, Kai seems to be missing half their right tusk.\n\n•Kai is bonded to an impressive number of wolves and is almost never found without one nearby.",

They were so small and considered weak growing up, spending much of their youth struggling behind their peers  and even their baby sister, Rulkah. When they came of age to undergo their om'riggor, Uruk-Kai exiled themself to the harsh wilderness of Frostfire Ridge to spare their family the pain of having to exile them themselves when they failed to pass. \n\nDuring their exile, Uruk-Kai honed their skills as a hunter and survivalist, and began to grow a considerable pack of wolves under their care. Eventually, Kai ventured from their snowy home when he met their lifemate, a Shattered Hand orc and fellow runt named Gret’ka Ripjaw. Together, the pair helped one another not only survive? But, also overcome any hardship that overtook Draenor and survive the tyrannus advent of Exarch Yrel and the Lightbound, escaping to Azeroth. \n\nOnce in Orgrimmar, Kai pledged themself as a tracker and was grouped up with a team of equally hopeful initiates into the Horde’s ranks. The group quickly impressed their superiors with their skills and they were almost immediately dispatched to Darkshore. While there, they showed unwavering loyalty to the Warchief, even after she burned the World Tree and incited disharmony amongst the ranks of the Horde itself. However, the war dragged on and the battlefront claimed many of Uruk-Kai’s new friends until only they remained. \n\nEver since they were recalled from Darkshore, Uruk-Kai has returned to Orgrimmar and has offered up their services as a tracker and hunter.",

Muscle forms beneath her ivory flesh, giving her a toned appearance. Her skin has become a canvas of ink and scars. First, there is the pair of claw marks upon her thighs, raking down to her knees. Then, raven ink, black as night etched into her back; a sigil of sorts. A magical ring. It's purpose is unknown, but each line o fit oozes with something unholy.\n\nTriviana's face is slender, her features well defined as expected of the Thalassian people. Her lips are pillowy, painted a glossy black. A pair of overgrown fangs press into the flesh and are often shown when she smirks. Large doll-like orbs hold a deep violet hue, gently glowing with a veridian mist. Wrapped by spidery lashes and deep eyeshadow, this makes her eyes look ablaze at times. Striking, even.\n\nCurtains of straight silvery locks fall down to her lower back, lingering with the scent of her many incesnses. Matching feathery brows are duel-pierced, the black metal threatening to only draw more colour out of her face and pallid tresses.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:7f5993}Of Fallen Faith{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:599c54}Triviana's is a dance of Fel and Shadow; the occult magics often helping her rip out the mournful spirits from the earth - those who do not wish to pass. However, her useage has begun to stain her form; her nails have grown black andclaw-like, while her fangs grow to unnatural lengths. The most telling is here eyes, however - as is with all elves. \n\nAlas, her devotion to the craft does not seem to waver, as she purges the world of the wandering dead and dubious demons. She does, however, make sure to keep her magics typically underwrap. Only spectral sight or the well-trained can feel her corruption oozing from her.\n\nHer occupation is quite literally worn upon her sleeve. Her form is littered with all of the tools one would expect of a witch hunter or exorcist. Charms, dark symbols, vials of holy water, and books containing questionable rituals all find a home upon The Faith Fallen.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:7f5993}\"If only we have some truth to believe in.\"{/col}{/h1}\n\n{h1:c}{col:7f5993}To Know The Fallen:{/col}{/h1}\n\n{h3}{col:599c54}† Are or were a member of The Church of The Light †{/col}{/h3}\n{col:599c54}Once a woman of the cloth, Triviana was adopted by the church, having lost her family at a young age. Raised in the temples, she was a respectable nun, despite never being able to use the Light.\nIn her late teen years, however, something caused her to abandon the church, going her own way.\nIt is unknown why she left, but the church grieved for their fallen sister.{/col}\n\n{h3:r}{col:599c54}† Live(d) in Quel'Thalas, Duskwood, or Lordaeron †{/col}{/h3}\n{p:r}{col:599c54}The dead have risen in these once vibrant homes, causing chaos for all who are caught in their path.\nTriviana is well known in these areas for helping qwell these threats - for a price, of course.

All the while, she aided in assassinations against said demonic foes, as well as retrieving some of their forbidden knowledge.\n\nOpinions are mixed about Triviana, but one thing is for certain - she does her job well.{/col}\n\n{h3:r}{col:599c54}† Are An Occultist †{/col}{/h3}\n{p:r}{col:599c54}In the past few decades, Triviana has begun to dabble in the very dark arts she combats. Stealing crumbs of knowledge, butchering covens, nothing seems to stop her from this thirst she has grown. Not much dust has been kicked up from this publically, but it is known among those with less than holy magics that she has begun dancing a path filled with shadow and demons.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:7f5993}\"I will regard their cries as braying steeds, waiting to be whipped, broken, and bridled.\"{/col}{/h1}\n{h1:c}{col:599c54}†{/col}{/h1}\n",

Bright green eyes had a warm glow that would be calming to those who did exchange glances, as well as supple lips, a button nose, and sunkissed cheeks. Almond shaped eyes had natural full lashes all complimented by dark layers of black eyeliner. Based on mood, she may seem bright and exuberant, welcoming, and energetic. Depending on the current outfit, a canvas of artwork would be visible, contrasting against the tanned skin. Long perky ears had small, black gauge hoops that just filled out her earlobe without causing any real stretch.\n\nWhat she lacks in size, she makes up for in attitude. At about 5'3\" and 120 lb, she is on the punier end of elves, but there was a certain confidence and grace that made her seem over 6 foot. Her frame was thin and lean, built for fast and silent movements but was just muscular enough to take a few shots. Curves were set in all the right places accentuating the beauty bestowed by her people. It appeared to be kept up with hinting at considerable effort directed towards diet and exercise.\n\nSoft, wavy brown hair fell to the middle of her back in thick, tamed locks. It would usually be tied in a loose crown braid or waterfall braids to keep her hair out of her face with bangs that framed her flawless cheeks. Frequently, the rest of the mass would be tied in a pony tail or collected into a large, messy bun. Tangled into that forest, an enchanted rose would be woven into a braid behind a long ear. In all, she was truly beautiful with a captivating, heart skipping gaze and smile if one were ever fortunate to meet it.\n\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/EllyRighthand*Right hand}: An intricate poison vial with a skull and crossbones on the glass.

(Just the very first picture of course)}\n{link*tinyurl.com/Ellyfaceclaim3*Another face claim}\n{link*tinyurl.com/1pchmblk*Yes, a claim to Selena Gomez, don't judge me}\n{link*tinyurl.com/Ellyscrownbraid*Hair references}\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality{/h1}\n\nWithin this bright mind rests locked away a sinister past that developed her into somebody manipulative and hostile, usually merciless at the best of times. A recipe for disaster spelt out with shark like aggresion: cold, tactile, facetious, and snark with emotionless brutality and disregard for the well being of most everyone except the ones who can crack through a near impenetrable shell. Her past is something she would rarely discuss, but she's a product of her environment as she had to take or fight for the simplest of necessities. Being such an isolated person, her tone of voice is very matter of fact or sarcastic. Antagonistic yet unnervingly calm under most circumstance, it would seem pressure was nearly weightless on her shoulders.\n\nShe is the embodiment of Jekyll and Hyde as her mood can fluctuate, sometimes within moments. Some have described her as a split person with bipolar tendencies ranging from mania to depression. Kindness comes during euphoric highs or the desire to acquire in conniving nature. This woman even gets a kick at times to puppet with emotions and she's damn good at playing the game by luring in the weak minded with charm and flirtation only to take advantage of misplaced trust. If she is after monetary gain and false friendliness doesn't work, she may not be above violence without remorse. Though pitiful in size, underestimating her could be a lethal mistake considering she may be quicker to pull a trigger or plunge a knife than consider the consequence. Lifelong struggles calloused her to affection and care, leading to a lone wolf complex that naturally tends to push people away, though she can act as a team member usually for nothing more than her best interest.\n\nCunning, logical, and realistic. She tends to think before she talks and attempts to plan ahead, though she does have impulsivity that leads to action prior to thought. For specific jobs, she plans from A through Z ready to react to any situation, but for daily interactions, she may be abrupt, unpredictable, and reactive. Tread carefully.\n\n\n{h1:c}Skills{/h1}\n\nA life on the streets has developed comfort picking locks and pockets alike, breaking into homes or into inns for a free place to sleep. Her feet move without any sounds, falling in a single file line to create a hypnotic sway of her hips.\n\nShe is adept at hand to hand combat, with or without weapons. Agile as they come, but able to fight with much larger and stronger opponents through leverage. There isn't much weight or significant power to throw around so the smaller elf has learned how to manipulate others movements against themselves. Because of this, her body moves with a flowing grace.\n\nIntrusive and rather friendly at the right time, she is well practiced at breaking down walls and leading people into false security due to a pretty face, silver tongue, soft voice, and traiterous smile.\n\nThrough her family name, she was naturally gifted with rogueish shadow magic. Her father, Aelinor Shadowmist, a terrible pirate who utilized the shadows, monopolized the talent in his own gain by raising the girl to be proficient in stealth and manipulating said dark magic. Her mother was a natural healer of the light, well talented, though the light never came to Elly. Instead, she learned to heal physically rather than magically from a surgeon aboard a ship. She uses herbs for poisons and potions alike as well as procedures and even shadow magic to a lesser proficiency for fixing wounds.\n\n\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\n\nAfter her broken family was mysteriously murdered at their home in Eversong Woods, she fled to the city. The girl was an outcast in Silvermoon as a child for her family name, thievery, robberies, and even an accused double homocide of a nobleman and Blood Knight. After that accusation, she became notoriously wanted and disappeared from the city to board a vessel. In this vessel, she was taught and honed her skills while working with all walks of life from both Alliance and Horde. She saw and participated in war, visualizing death in a very intimate fashion. Seeing a human who was able to heal without magic, she collected his knowledge for her own personal gain in case she were injured. When this vessel, The Daggermouth, was at last sunk, she was taken aboard a new ship that was not as welcoming to her presence. She was a forced medic given her acquired talents and of course lusty sailors persued her without success. Elly was trained well and able to defend herself, so she was sold for profit as an arena slave where she would fight for her life for entertainment. It was predictable. Wake up and fight. So she performed well for a warm bed and decent meal, not mention the reward of seeing the morning sun. There eventually came the time where she was prepared to leave, so after contemplation, she picked the lock to her cage and left the arena in a pool of the blood of her captors before escaping. A new life was eventually started with someone she grew to love and trust. A life no different than what she lived. Violence and self-gain. Eventually, a botched robbery of a supply vessel heading to The Broken Isles led to her capture and forced participation in the war against the Legion. At first, she was only a slave worker, but proved herself capable during an attack on the camp. She was promoted with the promise of release at the conclusion of the war, assuming she had survived. Giving her all, she made it through with her life only to return to a changed partner who eventually fled without warning, leaving Elly betrayed and alone. From then on, she lived for herself only getting by without much incentive or advantages to thrive. When the war between the Horde and Alliance resumed, she was forced to join the attack on Teldrassil, then to defend The Undercity. With her participation, she was granted full pardon and is considered a free person, though she is still not accustomed to such a life and as such constantly glances over her shoulder.\n\n{h2:c}Hooks{/h2}\n\n. Her family name is one that is despised among many and feared by the vulnerable. There were accusations of assaults, drug dealings, psychosis, dark magic use, piracy, extortion, torture, murder and likely anything in the name of self gain and preservation. Her family was found murdered in their home in the Ghostlands.\n \n. Troubled youth in Silvermoon. Frequently stole from vendors, pickpocketed and robbed civilians. Pretty well known to authority figures or city officials as an elusive nuisance. Allegedly, her crimes became more violent until she was charged with two murders in a robbery gone bad. A city guard and a civilian were stabbed multiple times and their possessions stolen. There is no proof on who did it, but suspiciously she seemed to have disappeared from town some time after it happened. Even currently, older and experienced figures of authority may be able to recognize her as the trouble maker (act out how you please, I don't mind confrontation!)\n\n. She spent much of her teenage years sailing the seas where her delinquent acts continued. Quite a few of these included seducing drunken sailors around town and robbing them after she lures them to privacy. She has gotten violent and hurt people if she doesn't get her way. \n\n. Elly was even sold to fight in the arena after being kidnapped and held hostage by some people. She was a strong fighter, so they decided to make profits. Brutality was further normalized as she was rewarded for her particularly gruesome kills. Eventually, she escaped leaving multiple people dead in her path.\n\n. For a while, she lived in Pandaria and Booty Bay. Very frequently, she visited Jade Forest and Halfhill Market.\n\n. She fought against the Legion throughout the Broken Isles. She served primarily as a combat medic in field, a scout, and a surgeon on bases. Notably, the elf healed without magic so some were not as receptive to her methods, seeing them as less efficient. There was also a number of accusations that she was a pirate who tried stealing supplies and she was sentenced to serve in the war. Thusly, she was not well trusted, being considered a traitor.\n\n. She was also in Darkshore and Undercity for boths attacks, not by choice. She served as a combat medic again, healing the wounded.\n\n. It is possible she may have provided first aid on your character for some situation, or will provide it if needed, though she makes no outward attempt to display her medical knowledge, save for the medical journal she carried on her all the time. \n\n. She sells potions and herbs! Things that affect the health in manners like modern day medicine. Some increase or decrease blood pressure, prevent seizures, restore vitamins and electrolytes, thin the blood, diuretics and more. Of course, not all herbs are good for health and she will low key sell poisons to those who inquire.  \n\nThese are just a few places to recognize her from, but she has lived several different aliases and has the habit of suddenly disappearing. Depending on what point in the timeline we are talking about, she could have been a totally different person. And depending which person she claimed to be would depend on her traits. It gets pretty complex so please pst me to clarify or if you want a hook specific for your character!\n\n{h2:c}Aliases{/h2}\n\nAngel - An alter ego of a priestess, dressed in holy looking robes of whites, golds and black. She assumed this ego shortly after meeting her ex-wife. Her brother-in-law developed an obsession with Elly and started a manhunt for her. He was of high authority and standing within Silvermoon City and put her back on high demand. For this reason, she became Angel to hide and walk freely as a healer. She claimed to be a priest, but obviously was not due to her lack of holy magic and heavy shadow aura.\n\nFeyli Featherbreeze - A name she assumed when dressed in her leathers. This was so that any crimes she committed would not be linked to her true personality. Feyli wields dual rapiers, red, black, and silver leathers, a whole plethora of other weapons, and poisons. Feyli is also a mercenary name who has been known to accept shady jobs for generous compensation.\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-ArcaneStorm:512:128}\n\n{h2:c}OOC!{/h2}\nIf you read all this, thank you! I know it was a lot, but I tried to tone down the length of her original TRP (which wiped a long time ago). It's still a WIP and I will probably make changes to reflect her current mentality which has changed somewhat since she is now considered free. Elly has lived a variety of lives under several aliases and as such, not everything is easily pinpointed exactly to her, but rather those alter egos she lived under. There are a number of hooks to walk up and plenty of backstories to be written, so if you're interested, message me and we can work out the finer details since the history section is a very brief synapse to give you an idea of who she is and what she's about.It also looks like most of the tattoo links don't go exactly where I want them to, so I'll fix it eventually>.<",

Her ears stand tall and alert above a pair of glowing blue eyes giving off the telltale blue mist, a sign of her undeath.\n\nHer armor, though variable, typically bears a green color, either dark or light depending on variables known to no one, potentially not even her. The actual style of the armor is much more standard for a Death Knight, with sharp edges and skulls and a generally menacing vibe that would probably be intimidating if she wasn't a small fox person. Or perhaps, in spite of it?\n\nAt her back rests a sword, massive for a Vulpera, longer than she is tall. It is a fairly standard Ebon Blade greatsword, glowing with unholy power that resonates well with her own powers.

When the Scourge invaded, she fought to defend her lands, she was just a humble priestess, so she wasn't able to do much. When Quel'thalas fell to the Scourge she joined up with the expedition along with their prince to find a cure and fight back the Scourge with the remnants of the Alliance of Lordaeron. This didn't last for long once the Grand Marshal had sentenced the expedition to death for consorting with Naga, she never made it to the portal when the escape to Outland began, instead she fled back to Quel'thalas. \n\nShe was almost killed by the Scourge, as well as the pursuing forces of the Alliance hunting her down, but she was saved by a group of mercenaries they easily dispatched both the undead and the Grand Marshal's forces. She repaid them by joining their warband, and abandoned her notions of the light and started training with a blade in the shadows, which she turned out to be pretty good at.\n\nShe eventually longed to return to her homeland and bid the mercenaries her farewell. She'll still do mercenary work as she's gained the taste of gold and always wants more now, doing nearly anything for gold or items of value.\n\nWhen the Scourge began their resurgence she fought to defend Quel'thalas once again and continues to do so, frequenting the city if she isn't being paid to go elsewhere and deal with specific targets across Azeroth.\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality{/h1}\n\nThe only things she seems to like are her own people and gold, she's very quiet, a habit she's had when stalking prey for hours.\n\n{h1:c}Equipment and Appearance{/h1}\n\nShe wears mercenary armor, finely crafted leather with bandages wrapped around her arms and legs. It has several pouches, knives and other vairous tools an assassin would use. She's nice on the eyes, as most of her kind are, her silver hair shines with the moon, her hair also covers her blind eye. She also wears a mask to conceal her lower face.\n\nShe wields spectral daggers that seemingly pass through armor and only make contact with flesh, they shine a red sinister glow and are surprisingly cold to the touch.\n",

She doesn't do much in the way of care for her hair style, keeping it short for mainly practical reasons and its easy to rush into battle with, as it doesn't delay her actions.\n\nNay's face has a slight heart shape to it, denoting a former beauty that is now replaced with scars where the transofmation to a Demon Hunter had her rip her eyes out with blades.  \nTypical to other Illidari, her eyesockets are covered by a plain red cloth that only shows the glowing of her fel flame eye sockets.\nJust above her forhead, the Illidari woman bears the visible markings of her trade in the form of two recurved horns that are deep red-brown and give a familiar look to those of a shivara.\nWhen following the scars along the eyesockets down her cheeks, the ugly rips end abruptly at her thin, yet deep cimson lips.\n\nThe rest of her body reflects parts of her former life as a warrior in service to the crown.  Her shape is typical for a muscular elven woman, with her thighs and biceps showing more bulk than other parts of her body. \nGlancing at her upper body, the two most noticable part of her body are her breasts, and her biceps.  Her upper arms have an almost prefect round hump from formerly heaving a huge double bladed axe, and now because of twin demonic-flamed enhanced warglaives. \n\nNayla is currently seen wearing a set of armor reflecting the heritage of her Sin'dorei blood and the people of Silvermoon itself, since the fall of the Burning Legion.  She carries a set of warglaives that are made of magical fire to enhance the appearance.\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality:{/h1}\nNayla has basically evolved her personality from that of an absolute demon killer, to one of a softer and more inqusititve tone.\nShe is somewhat socially inept. Things that people take for granted, she can have problems catching the meaning.\nHer biggest answer to most situations is simply, \"I haven't given much thought to it.\"\nWhen asked what she does like, she will answer with mostly two things.  The color red and the physical look of Orcs.\nPersonal questions she will answer fair and polite, unless it is about the demon she consumed.  \nOverall, the elven woman is friendly, or trying to be.\n\n{h1:c}Background:{/h1}\nBorn as Naylaneth she was the first of the Jaydenthorn girls, raised mostly in the city of Andorhal.  She spent most of her young life following in her fathers footsteps with the love of fishing and the water.  She worked on the many boats he did and traveled, learning the beauty of the world around her. \nNay was often tasked with lifting and carrying the heaviest of loads for the dock workers, because of her natural size.\nHer father noticed that as time went on, her real talent was in the ability to swing a shield and sword.  He worked it out with the guard so she could squire with them and gain the ability to become a warrior and protect those around her.\nAll was fine until the scourge attacked.\nNay lost everything in her life in those moments.  Her mother and father killed in the initial wave, her sister missing in the Ghostlands.\nLost and without a cause, the young warrior stepped out into the now darkened world, and killed anything that moved or caused threat to people around her.  She was reckless, not caring if she lived or died.  \nCrossing over the Dark Portal, she fought her way to Shadowmoon Valley, and ultimately to Black Temple itself.\nShe sought out the others on the temple walls, and pledged herself to the Master.. Illidan.\nThat day, Naylaneth the warriror died, and was replaced with Naylatari, Demon Hunter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In fact, at her height, she barely reaches a normal elven woman's shoulder. Her skin overall is pale, as though she's never seen the light of day, even when standing in it. Light blue eyes have bags and dark circles around them. No more enchantment to make them appear green! Despite the tired appearance, if she ends up looking into someone's eyes, she's still got the youthful, \"stare right through the soul\" gaze a woman half her age would have. \n\nPouty lips are often stained with a ruby pigment, usually quirked at the corners with a smirk, be it from mirth or something more sinister. Through her lower lip on the right side are four tiny truesilver loops that hug the plump, crimson flesh, and two truesilver tongue rings accented with azerothian diamonds can often be seen glinting between her lips. The tongue rings are set one behind the other.\n\nTwo truesilver hoops pierce the top of her left ear, while one decorates the upper right, all three loops small enough not to snag, given the fragility of those long elven ears. Three titansteel bars decorate the thicker, starting point of each brow, curved and thin with small dreadstone balls on either end. A tiny silver stud decorates the left nostril of a tiny, slightly upturned nose, along with an itty bitty dark iron rose. \n\nRed locks have been hacked away by a dull blade and finished by an unsteady hand, creating a shaggy, unkempt look. It seems she doesn't mind this however, as she rarely does more than scratch at her head, the only 'decoration' found here being the one thing no modern day rogue dares advertise, especially on their person. \n\nThe name \"Sujikai\" has been tattooed in elegant, black script across the back of her neck. Can't get more identifying than that.  A silver chain hangs around that neck; from it dangles an obsidium ring with an obsidian 'jewel' that glows a dim blue shade at all times. This rests against her breastbone at the top of her cleavage, usually visible.\n\nPetite shoulders are half the width of most full grown elven women's, collarbone the perfect example of fragility, though it's hidden beneath a fine layer of fat.  An average torso possesses sides that slope inward gently from beneath the ribs to flare again at broad hips. Her bosom appears plump and well rounded, though the flesh sags when left alone, her choice in tight leather tops and harnesses keeps this area -looking- perky at a glance.\n\nThe woman's midsection is muscular, but plagued by a layer of squishy fat left over from several pregnancies. If one happens to see her stomach exposed, the glinting of a diamond becomes obvious in the dip of her navel, a truesilver hoop pierced through the flesh above with a small chain of the same material allowing it to dangle down. \n\nLong, toned arms appear to be those of a climber, complete with delicate though strong fingers. Her nails are always clipped short, squared off, and painted with a brilliant crimson polish, while her palms and the pads of her fingers lack any sort of callousing. \n\nA bit further down, well padded hips become the focus point, about the same width as her shoulders, a bubbled, plump behind completing this package. Legs that make up for the most of her scant height begin with thick thighs that look untoned, though there is indeed muscle beneath the pudgy exterior. The surprisingly well sculpted calves of a runner lead into sturdy ankles and small feet, usually hidden in boots.\n\nOn the back of her left shoulder, the insignia of the horde has been tattoo'd into pale skin, another found along the curve of her left hip, black ink reading \"Victory or Death\" in Orcish text. Starting just beneath her shoulders and working down, forest green ivy vines have been inked into pale flesh, several intricate treasure chest locks and keys strategically placed about in the mess. Those locks and keys are inked in bronze just like the one described below, glinting in the light like real metal when she moves. \n\nMoving further down her back, just above her rump, in fact, one would find an intricate treasure chest lock inked in bronze, shaded in to look precisely like the real thing. If exposed, each of her wrists and ankles have been tattoo'd with chains that possess the same intricate treasure-chest lock as the ones on her back, in a smaller scale, both the chains and the locks in these places done in bronze ink, the locks set on the fronts of each.\n\nThe middle finger of her right hand sports a pure elementium band, flawless, indestructible, and usually heading the blows when her fist meets flesh. The same finger on her left hand sports an identicle band, along with a dark iron one set with tiny heart shaped inferno rubies. Her right ring finger sports a flawless elementium band decorated with tiny heart shaped dreadstones. {/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:ffa2f9}Fragrance{/col}{/h1}\n{p:c}{col:e170ff}The scent usually lingering on her form is that of various herbs, coconut rum, and vanilla. If for some reason, however, one is excessively close to her; the scent of cloves drowns out anything else. Especially when it comes to her breath.{/col}{/p}\n\n",

His fur is a dirty tan, with some mottled black spots, particularly on the tips of his ears and on his tail. His fur has a bit of a scraggly appearance, it's almost as if he cuts it with his knife, becaus he does. His usual clothing of choice is his leather plains garb, strewn together from various animal skins, including crocolisks, kodo and raptors. Corin carries several weapons on him, consisting of a large bowie knife he keeps sheathed on the side of his boot, a trio of small throwing daggers hanging from his shoulder, and his six round revolver holstered on his hip. Because of his time spent in areas such as the barrens and Vol'dun, he is usually covered in a light layer of dust and sand, and he carries the scent of the wilderness behind him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality{col:c0a72e}{/col}{/h1}\n     Having been brought up in a simple but hard life, Corin has devealoped into quite the blunt Vulpera, never afraid to tell someone what's on his mind, or suggest his \"to the point\" solutions to many of his problems. He is not well versed in the \"higher\" forms of art or culture, such as magic or reading, preferring to surround himself in and embrace what he's good at. He generally prefers to be by himself most times, and as such will usually not surround himself with several people, and his circle of those he calls friends may be small. When it comes to his work, he is persistent to the point of being stubborn, and will do everything he can to ensure the job is done and done well, no matter how rough he may have to be to get it done. Because of these traits, he may come off as rough around the edges around new faces, although he will warm up eventually.",

But here's a few things to know\n\nRivetea was practically born on a pirate ship and raised by pirates that are no longer around and disbanded a few years ago, She got her scar on her eye from being dragged under that ship by something she doesn't recall all she can remember is stabbing it in its eye and swimming for her life back to the surface to be rescued by her crewmates\n\nAs a retired pirate she still took an intrest in rare and exotic beast taming/collecting when she ran into her first ever beast she tamed Torraske the Eternal. Found out she had a real knack for it, forming deep and personal connections with the ones she tamed and it seemed to fill a hole that had been left after her entire crew disbanded. Now she travels the world looking for more exotic beasts to add to her collection and befriend.\n\nShe's a very mischievous Vulpera that doesn't understand 'treat others the way you want to be treated' and doesn't get friendship really due to days of sailing at sea with a crew that only knew how to mess with each other so she has a tendency of lying to mess with people and doesn't feel bad/gulity about it until someone calls her out or by some miricale realizes she did something wrong. She sucks at apologizing too.\n\nShe is so smelly and can be super selfish!\n\nWill edit and add more later!",

He prefers to tie his hair back with a long and strong-looking vine into a long and wild looking ponytail, leaving his bangs to frame around the left and right side of his face nicely. It is clear he is Quel'dorei, hence the blue colored eye on the left side of his face. Adorned around his waist is a sort of kilt made of different furs from Lannivath's hunts, perfectly stitched together, with the thinner and lighter-colored furs wrapped around the top, accompanied by white-furred trim, and the longer and darker-colored fur trailing from the center to bottom. The kilt is held together by a large and rounded belt, with a symbol at the center that appears Nordic in nature. On closer inspection, three bones can be seen decorated around the bottom of the darker fur, from smallest to largest. They appear to be made from the ribs of smaller and bigger animals. On his right eye, however, he wears an eyepatch. Four large and rather prominent claw marks can be seen vertically slashed over his right eye, all the way up to part of his cheek. On his right forearm, light brown bandages cane be seen wwrapped around it, hiding old and nasty looking scars of teeth markings that had torn through flesh, not exactly healing properly. It's no wonder he keeps it wrapped up then! If one were to look close enough, his eye behind his eyepatch seems to sometimes emit a faint, golden glow based on his emotions, whether he is happy or upset. It's clear that something is up, though if one were to ask, Lannivath would simply disregard the subject, as he is quite adamant about keeping his eyepatch. If one were to earn his trust, then perhaps he would be more willing to talk about it.\n\nAs a Quel'dorei, one would think that Lannivath would take better care in his appearance, but honestly, he couldn't care less. While most would prefer the fancy and luxurious lifestyle of the city, Lannivath would prefer spending his time within the great outdoors, especially within the company of animals. More specifically, wolves. Interesting enough, wolves seem to take a strong liking to Lannivath the most, whether they are tame or feral. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that Lannivath appears and smells... more wolf than humanoid, as he sports a distinct wolf scent, long canines, and claw-like nails, and abnormal body heat. His agility, strength, and reflexes appear to be a lot more advanced than most too, in regards to a wolf. Upon the left side of his pectoral, a tattoo of a wolf paw surrounded by a sort of celtic spike symbol can be seen, while around the right side of his ear, two adolescent-looking wolf teeth can be seen through the inside of his right ear, around the top, a further implication that Lannivath is quite accustomed to wolves. \n\nWhat seems to stand out the most from his appearance would be the large looking skull from a great timber wolf perched upon his left shoulder. It seems to emit a strange, shimmery, golden glow from around it, as if it was almost... still alive. Lannivath wears this skull out of great respect towards the wolf, rather than wear it as a trophy. He is hardly ever seen without it, not only because he sees it as a sort of companion and guide of sorts, but also serves as an example of his past, to remind him of a promise he intends to keep.{/p}{/col}\n\n{h1:c}{col:ae7641}Personality{/h1}{/col}\n\n{p:c}{col:412c18}To most that first interact with him, Lannivath is quite the friendly, caring, playful and easygoing individual. Unless you give him a reason not to, he happens to love meeting new people. Interesting, considering he has spent most of his young life in the wilderness with his wolves as company; though it doesn't mean he has ever been robbed of human companionship. He is actually quite happy with either. While having lived in the wild, among wolves and other animals, he happens to also have a sort of shameless streak in his personality. It's one of the things he happens to be so easygoing and playful about; playing little pranks or teasing others to get a smile, a laugh, or even a small blush out of them. He is quite energetic and loves to have fun with people, especially if it comes to a bit of friendly competiton. Not just that, but he can also sometimes do or say things that wouldn't exactly be classified as \"dignified\" or \"normal\", coming from a Quel'dorei especially. One example of this is that he seems to hold conversations with wolves, or any wolf, really. Hah! As if they could ever respond to him, right?\n\nEven with his playful and easygoing attitude, he is not without his serious and more noble qualities either. To those he trusts and loves dearly, he is very protective of and would give his life for in order to keep them safe. Family and friends are very precious to him, as he considers those part of \"his pack\". As such, he refuses to turn a blind eye to those in need or leave any of his \"pack members\" behind when they're in trouble.. The same goes for animals too. He hates seeing animals in fear or in any pain and will do his absolute best to help take care of them, as a promise he made years ago to his mentor.{/p}{/col}\n\n",

From a banner pole affixed at his back, cloth and cured flesh stir in the breeze - stained blue with dye and red with blood, the insiginia of the Horde stitched there matching the brand mark that ruins the fur of the great Bull's shoulder.{/col}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-55:64:64}\n{h1:c}His War-Kit{/h1}\n\n    {col:ffffff} The massive sword of dark steel lies lashed to the back of the Warrior, the blade angled in its primitive sheath so that the jagged edge rests to the side of the great riding beast's hips. The Tauren's preference for efficiency over design stands obvious - blades rest in sheaths about his thick frame, axes and crude cutting weapons strapped to his belt, his boots. The wicked, uneven edges of the blades fray their crude leather sheaths. The massive two handed weapon at his back is adorned with a skull of a great beast, it's great horn cracked in twain.{/col}\n\n    {col:ffffff} His weapons, much like his armor, is jagged and without elegance. Much like Bhrute himself.{/col}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-AlliedRace-Highmountain:256:128}\n{h1:c}His Wyrd{/h1}\n\n    {col:ffffff}All those who carried his family's name are dead, and he alone remains. He is the last son of the last son, a line of long-dead tribe, some honoured, others cursed, all proud and spitting their defiance at their last. He has fought under many flags, on many battlefields. He has spilled his enemies’ blood on the crust of many strange lands, and he has trod his heavy iron-shod feet into the halls of ally and bane, god and demon, dragon and man alike. {/col}\n\n     {col:ffffff}None have been his doom.{/col}\n\n     {col:ffffff}The blessings and curses of his life are obvious, for the hulking Tauren's step is haunted by shades. Whispers abound amongst the Horde warrior's desperate quarries that shadowy whispers from his ancestors guide him to a death full of glory and honour, luring the Bull to his prey with an unnatural accuracy and swiftness.. Many of the rank-and-file in the military regard him with both relief and fear - that he is present does as much to calm the unit he's assigned to as it does to unnerve them, for Bhrute's search for glory is well known. It would not take a shamn to see the scores of spirits clinging to his bloodied, scarred hands, desperate to lead the massive brute towards a worthy death shrouded in glory.{/col}\n\n",

Like the animal she is naturally drawn to, she portrays many features of a feline- aloof, wary, and hard to trust. When around others that has earned her favor, affection and tenderness may slip in with the rest of her demeanor. The kicker to Vor’biba is her tendency to switch on the dime, either to suit the situation or suit her personal desires. Artificially, many see her as timid, a suck-up, or too cocky for her own good. To pin down what she is truly like would require time and understanding, and she will sometimes do her best to remain vague to keep her distance. \n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sandstorm:512:3}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ffc232}{icon:crest_monk:20}{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_kimibul:25}Physical Description{icon:ability_racial_embraceoftheloa_kimibul:25}{icon:crest_monk:20}{/h3}\n{col:67d57f}This troll hails from the harsh dunes of Tanaris, seen by the light, dry skin from the very first impression. Her head is full of a vibrant red mane, streaks of blue sneaking their way throughout. She holds it up in a golden band, various locks braided. If one was to get closer to the troll, they would see her dazzling blue eyes, the pupils looking narrow like that of a cat. She has stiff ears, still capable of twitching and angling slightly to listen in to all the sounds around her. On her light skin are brilliant red stripes, a sign of her worship to Kimbul. They travel down her arms, decorate her face, and even hug along her ribs. When going down to her hands, the nails are darker and sharp, kept pointed like claws. Physically she is in top shape, holding a curvy figure to fill out her usual choice of wear.\n\n{col:67d57f}She currently has a heavy wooden staff that she has strapped securely upon her back, which has a leather bag tied to it, along with a heavy keg storing her supply of water. Surprisingly very few tattoos or piercings mark this sand troll, her body kept altered only to the likeness of her Loa.\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sandstorm:512:3}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ffc232}{icon:misc_legionfall_monk:20}{icon:ability_monk_touchofkarma:25}Current Interests{icon:ability_monk_touchofkarma:25}{icon:misc_legionfall_monk:20}{/h3}\n{col:67d57f}{icon:ability_monk_serenity:25}Now that she has joined the Horde, this sand troll is looking for opportunities of any type. Connections, jobs, and above all, a teacher to better help her understand what it takes to become a monk. \n\n{col:67d57f}{icon:ability_monk_serenity:25}If she is going to learn the culture of the Pandaren with the path she took, then it is only fair to understand their deities in better detail. What does each Celestial do? What are they capable of? She wants to know all of this, and is looking for anyone who might be able to give her the knowledge she desires. \n\n{col:67d57f}{icon:ability_monk_serenity:25}She's perfect for finding on the road, just about anywhere. There is always a destination, but what it is and where she goes is decided on a mere whim. Who knows what sort of adventure may lie in wait with this sand troll?\n\n{col:67d57f}{icon:ability_monk_serenity:25}This may come as a surprise, but this sand troll has a personal interest in learning about the other races that reside on Azeroth. Of course, she still holds onto a bitterness for how the Horde and Alliance played their part in attacking the Farraki. Even then, she's willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. The only race she still cares nothing for, of course, are the goblins. \n\n\n",

Her skin was taut, and her complexion clear. She had pretty features with observant, smiling purple eyes, a slightly bulbous nose, and full lips, often playing home to a mischevious little grin. She adorned herself with hoops of silver and studs of amethyst in her ears and nostrils and kept her platinum hair in a loose, lazy ponytail. She rounded out the look with just enough blush and eyeliner of kohl.\n\nShe was thin, as mages tended to be, though not sickly by any means, with a petite feminine frame, dressed often in modest, but finely made purple robes. Slung about her torso was a satchel of black leather which hung at her side. The strap had loops stitched in, where she stored a staff of silver and amethyst across her back. And those colors seemed to repeat as a theme over and over. Purple, silver and black. Her fingers all hosted rings of silver, set with opals, amethysts, jet and obsidian.\n\nHer mannerisms however, did not match her looks or dress. Where at a glance, once might expect a demure, refined little Goblin, she was somehow still rougher around the edges. Perhaps it was a consequence of whatever fueled her ability, or the rumored neccessity of palling around with the underworld for the years she was missing, but something about her was just... Odd. Something aside from the near insane ramblings, anyway.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-ArcaneStorm:512:128}\n\n\"No, it ain't as controversial as some of the things I could get up to, but there's a reason a lotta mages stick to fire an' ice. An' the way I went about it? let's say the Kirin Tor don't count me as a friend, an' leave it there.\"\n\nWhat cost, power? Millastra, in her time with the Kirin Tor would first have been called a student of great promise, later a troublemaker lacking focus, and later still, persona non grata. The reasons for this are kept quiet but... People talk.\n\nIt was said that first, the outspoken young Goblin began questioning the value of her course work, the wisdom of her superiors, and the strict control the Kirin Tor exercised over its members. From there, she began rallying against those senior casters, accusing them of hoarding knowledge, and limiting the more junior members in what they could learn or do. The last straw was said to have been a late night raid she alone executed, making off from the floating city with a litany of scrolls and tomes. If that last bit were true, it was odd that she wasn't hunted by the Kirin Tor. Again, people talk... But not always truthfully.\n\nWhatever the truth, and despite her departure Millastra, who seemed to be a falling star in her exile from Dalaran, came out the other side somehow... Smarter than she ought to be. Having left only a few years into her training, she was considered a novice at best when she disappeared. When she turned back up in Orgrimmar some three years on however, she spoke of odd realities and limitless potentials, and more importantly, had somehow come into a great deal of arcane power; casting offensive spells of raw arcane energy and expressing easy mastery over conjuration and portal magic.\n\nThe why and how of this sudden gift was unclear. She seemed to be protected from most forms of scrying, and while she carried a clearly arcane aura, nothing about it would hint at anything more devious than countless years of study. Countless years she somehow crammed into three all the same. She and a select few likely knew the truth of it all, the secret source of her power, or the trick she was pulling, whichever it happened to be; but she wasn't talking, and the Kirin Tor remained ever abrupt about the topic.\n",

A quick pat to the center of his formal chestpiece attempts to clear up any phlegm and further confusion. The tauren then announces, \"My name is Sweet Nectar, botanist, agriculturist and apiculturist.\"\n\nThe orc recruiter tilts his head with a furrowed brow, \"A what?! Cultist?! No, no, we can't have that within city limits. I'm afraid we can't... oh, you mean beekeeper. That's fine. Completely different. We are in need of those keen in agriculture. Perfect. I assume you are wise with plants, farming, things of that nature. Or, nature in general.\"\n\nWith that, the somewhat eager bull nods, \"Yes. I know much of how to grow flora. Although, I am not sure if Durotar has the right conditions for farming. Well, perhaps some foods will grow here. With a lot of care, and time.\"\n\n\"That is why we need people such as yourself! But, do you have any other skills? Something outside the realm of farming. We have plenty of farmers, but need others willing to march to the front lines. You have the body for an axe if you ask me!\"\n\nThe tauren made a face, scrunching his nose and casting his eyes away from the recruiter. \"No. No weapons training here. Just farming... Uhh, maybe I know a thing or two about mending wounds.\"\n\n\"Medic! Got'cha! Aw! Wow, I'm gonna make a big bonus off of you, kid. Heh heh. Well, I guess that's it. Not like you'd get rejected or anything but here ya go! Here's your insignia, your barracks bunker number and axe! Complimentary to new recruits. Makes you feel like a real grunt, huh?!\" the recruiter said, trying to motivate the rather unenthusiastic greenhorn.\n\nThe youthful bull didn't speak right away. He'd shrug his shoulders and grumbles, \"Yeah, a real grunt. Can you put me somewhere at the back of the battle? I'm really not a fan of... war.\"\n\nThe orc bursts into laughter, \"Then why did you join up, kid?! We're knee deep in conflict at all times. What, like we'd have you in the fields with a hoe?! BAH-HAH! Oh, no. We're gonna work you good on the battlefield, son! Now, get that flower out of your head and march down to the Hall of Legends, we're not done with your registration.\"\n\nSighing, the bull nods and shovels off to follow the recruiter. From the awkward lack of space within the office to the open roads of Ogrimmar, the bull peers out towards the many faces and various walks of life. The slight melancholy upon his face melts away, happy to be surrounded by so much life, so many cultures.\n\nThis is what he joined for; To assist those around him no matter their creed or means of honor. To him, life was precious no matter where it may come from. It was beyond the service of a banner, or faction. It was a calling to protect all that walk upon the Earth Mother, a duty he'd claim until his death.\n\n--------------\n\n{link*/c/sweetnectar*/c/}\n\n\n",

He doesn't care much for the Elements. He swears like a sailor. He likes to drink, fight, and fuck. He hates philosophy, religion, or indeed any question of any depth at all. Even for a warrior, he's aggressive and loud, a black sheep amongst his people.\n\nPhysically, Rendrok is a brutish figure, so much so that there's doubtlessly some ogre blood in his lineage. He's a wall of muscle and armor, the black hue of his skin mingling with the reds and pewters of his plate until he seems nothing so much as a rusty golem. Of course, the Blackrock is very much alive. He shows it by his booming laugh, his fast grin, and his insatiable appetites. \n\nHis face is broad, with a jaw that could cut through rock, square and prominent. It's often covered by dark stubble, Rend taking only the most intermittent care to shave himself. He sports intense, burning eyes and a nose that has been raked by a claw at some point in the past, leaving behind a pair of scars across the bridge. \n\n{link*tinyurl.com/RendrokDoodle*Sketch done by Ireigh because she's awesome.}",

Sari is a whimsical spirit, she enjoys her wine just as much as the next elf and is either busy with paperwork, chatting, doing stupid things, or of course internally arguing with her demon Kha'Reis, AKA Karen. Despite Sari's positive demeanor she is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, while seeming innocent and sweet, she takes great pleasure in tearing her enemies, namely demons, limb from limb in a sadistic fashion. Her usual occupation as most Demon Hunters is with the Illidari, she typically patrols the Broken isles and other once demon infested areas as a guardian to stem any rising threats of demonkind that may surface.\n\nSari doesn't know much about her past, most of her long term memory was lost during the pairing ritual between her and her demon. The faces of her parents or any other family she may have had are lost to her, she recalls her family name, and has small blurs of what once was her life before becoming a demon huntress. The one thing that sticks with her from her past life, is her unbridled hate for demon kind, though she is unsure of its origin. \n\nSome demon hunters grow scales and hardened skin, others get acid blood, Sari was graced with keeping her normal looks,gained  horns, wings, and of course her ethereal sight, hers however, is more of a far sightedness. She is unable to see close up things very well, images return to her in a fuzzy fashion, however, she can \"see\" and feel things coming from very far away. \n\nThe ritual Sari went under was a special case, her demon was a powerful hybrid of sayaad and annihilan (pit lord), many students were lost in attempts to subdue the demon that inhabits Sari. What made Sari compatible with Kha' Reis was her personality and hatred for demonkind. Where Kha Reis wishes for the destruction and doom of all things, Sari counteracts those traits with her positive demeanor and attitude towards demonkind. \n\nSicne the fall of the legion Sari has allied her interests primarily with that of the horde, while not on mission she spends most of her time fighting off the forces of N'Zoth, battling the alliance where it is appropriate, rescuing cats from trees with her amazing climbing abilities, teaching children how to draw simple shapes and of course, leisurely drinking and getting into whimsical nonsensical trouble somewhere somehow.",

At the age of Seventeen, Morok was on his way to becoming a Wolfrider. A very challenging thing to do because of the various steps it took to become one. He joined the legendary Grommash Hellscream on many raids of ogre villages and he enjoyed it with every ounce of him. This all continued until Gul'dan came to them all. Many of the Warsong orcs were the first to drink the demon blood, Morok did so proudly. This lead up to the Dark Portal.\n\n{/col}{/p}\n",

Raised among the other orphans he grew to commune with the spirits. Speaking to his parents, and ancestors. The Shaman took him in, and he began to naturally progress. \n\nEarning the name Stormhand for his use of lightning, and the power he displayed with it. He began his long journey within the rising Horde. Joining in hopes to save his world, and taking the Fel. His power grew, his body grew. He loved the feeling, but it came at a terrible price. \n\nHis conquering days are behind him. No longer locking those in chains, or enslaving them to his will. He teaches and guides now, though he still feels the pull to his previous life.  \n\n\n{h2:c}Draenor{/h2}\n\nBefore his coming to Azeroth, Mutorm was of Draenor, the blood of the Ancestors pulsed through him. Then came the war against the Draenei. His axes slick with their blood, the cries they made when he cut them down. He wouldn't hesitate to say at the time he enjoyed it. Casting bolts, crushing them under rocks, he used the Elements to fight them, and before long he had nothing left to fight. The Horde moved on, and he with them as the Dark Portal opened and he flooded into Azeroth with his kin.\n\n{h2:c}First War{/h2}\n\nComing out in the Black Morass, Mutorm was one of the first to meet these new people. Strange, smaller things that were pink and weak. His axes cleaved through them with ease. The Fel magic flowing through him made him feel strong, like ten warriors instead of just one. He burned Westfall, dragging those that were weak, and killing all those who rose arms to defend themselves. The hit and run tactics of Warchief Blackhand were strong, but soon enough the Humans struck back. Strangely none of the other kingdoms helped, Mutorm would think it would make sense for them to band together in defense of their home. \n\nIn the end he cared little, and decided these weak things were nothing better than practice. Though the humans managed to defeat the Horde three years later, at the first Siege of Stormwind. He thought that Blackhand was losing his touch after his brush with death, and killing the two Warlocks was senseless. \n\nAfterwards it feel to Doomhammer, one that Mutorm respected greatly, to build a barracks and strategic outpost of Kyross. They crushed any that stood before them and they were sent word to go fetch the Warchief's daughter. Mutorm was left at the barracks, and before long were under attack. After the reenforcements appeared the raiders were swiftly crushed. \n\nAfter the Horde mastered the new Magic of the humans, they marched up towards Stormwind once more. \n\n\n\n(MASSIVE WIP) \n",

Passed down by a lineage proud of its bearings and refined by years of athleticism and martial charge, his features are noticeably sharp. Sitting atop a lantern-jaw and a neck corded by muscle, his face is well-balanced and equally whetted. High cheekbones rise up and protrude out of the sides of his face, framing his Aquiline nose. Though rarely seen, two fel-fire 'eyes' sit deep in each socket beneath a thick brow ridge, that overlaid by two often-trimmed and exceedingly strong black eyebrows. \n\nTwo basalt-colored horns act as the centerpiece for his fel-wracked frame. Protruding out of his head and bending back into a high arc against it, each horn has been pared by years of engagement. They sit eternally perched on his head, wrapped at their base by roots tethered to tendrils of inky black hair whose depth is softened by gentle waves throughout.\n\nHis frame is padded by lean muscle cast in scaled, armor-like skin, giving him a distinctly reptilian appearance. Huge blocks of inked skin are collaged together across his body and are segregated only by thin, wispy negative spaces which flare with fel energy when it is expended in a quantity large enough to be tangible to others in some way. The patterns range from geometric to chopped shades of black and grey.\n\nLong strands of inky black hair branch down over his scalp into soft, tendril-like curls that curtain his shoulders. His gaze is striking when unveiled: the fel-fire which has taken the place of his eyes, the sockets emptied aside from it, flares with the intensity of a chaos bolt beset by gasoline when he fixes onto something or someone. Like many of his kin, he is proud to a point of being haughty, resilient to the point of being relentless, and steely to the point of being cruel. A true Sin'dorei if there ever was one. \n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-ToxicFumes:512:128}",

						["TX"] = "Bel'dare was born in Quel'thalas along with her sister who was called Sin’salama. Their parents were both skilled mages. She was taught much about the arcane, but her studies were cut short, when her parents both died while fighting off the scourge. Bel'dare was just a child and so was Sin’salama at the time of Arthas' invasion and so she just used some magic to help her and her sister stay invisible long enough to stay hidden for the scourge to pass through their house. They were obviously saddened by the death of their parents, but they were nowhere near powerful enough to take on the scourge to get vengeance. They knew they had to get out of Quel'thalas, so she just went south. The young elves did not know where she was going, but they were certainly going. They encountered much scourge along the way and had to either fight them off or run away from them. They saw no living beings for years until she met a strange dwarf paladin called Dagagada. Bel'dare demanded the dwarf explain what had just happened. Dagagada explained that Arthas was originally a \"decent lad\" who he even fought alongside, but that he changed when they arrived in Stratholme. He explained how the grain there was infected with the plague of undeath and how Arthas wanted to destroy the whole town. He and many other people refused to do so, and for that they were all relieved of their positions by Arthas. He then said that he went to northrend for a bit, came back and then went full evil. The young elves thanked the paladin and asked that he train them, so justice could be served to the scourge. The dwarf accepted and taught them how to fight along with the ways of the light. They then departed from the dwarf and went to slay more undead to the south. They eventually arrived in Khaz Modan, unfortunately the blood elves  had just recently become part of the horde and she was attacked. While Bel’dare managed to avoid the dwarven bullets, her sister was not so lucky. They went back to Lordaeron with Sin’salama somewhat injured, they were fortunate enough to come across a forsaken camp. The forsaken immediately went about healing Sin’salama, they both became very afraid as they thought they were scourge who were going to kill and reanimate her. They were both restrained and healed. Bel'dare asked them who they were and they explained how they broke free from the lich king's will and taken over Lordaeron. They also spoke of how the now blood elves had joined the Horde. While Sin’salama went off to join the horde, Bel’dare just waited many days for many days confused on what to do as she could not try to rejoin the Alliance, nor did she want to join the horde.Eventually, when it was revealed that Arthas had awoken, she decided to swallow her pride and she joined the Horde offensive in Northrend. After slaying much scourge in the Borean Tundra, she made her way to Icecrown and joined the Argent Crusade. After Arthas eventually fell, she pondered what to do, as she was not interested in waging war against the alliance. She wanted to join the Blood Knights, but then she learned about how they had once enslaved a being of pure light (M'uru that is) to get their powers. Then strangely enough, she met her undead sister who went to join the horde all those years ago. She explained how she became a blood knight while she was with the horde, but fell in battle against the scourge when sweeping through Lordaeron. She explained how she was raised by Arthas and committed horrible crimes while under his grip. She described her change of heart at light’s hope and begged Bel’dare for forgiveness. Bel’dare replied that while she did forgive her for crimes while still bound to Arthas, she did not forgive her for stealing power from the enslaved nauru Mu’ru as she was not mind controlled at the time. This response made Sin’salama confused, as her crimes while a blood knight paled in comparison to her crimes as death knight. She apologized for stealing power from Mu’ru, but Bel’dare was not having it. The two cut all ties for a while.Now out of threats to deal with Bel’dare waited until Garrosh came along, of course Garrosh went on his war campaign in Pandaria and continued to alienate most members of the horde, including Bel'dare, however she was not very interested in that drama. She did however, join the siege of Orgrimmar. When the legion came once again to Azeroth. She had learned that they were the ones responsible for creating the lich king and the scourge and she was eager for vengeance against them. She also participated in the third battle of Light’s Hope where the Ebon Blade tried to raise Tirion, during the battle she saw her sister with the ebon blade. She was about to charge at her, but then she saw, she was not actually on the ebon blade’s side. Sin’salama was actually attacking the ebon knights. After the battle was over, Bel’dare realized that by doing this, Sin’salama had essentially kicked herself from the ebon blade and made herself a target. Thankful for this sacrifice, she finally forgave her sister for her crimes as a blood knight.When the legion were pushed back she somewhat withdrew from adventuring. She later learned of the crimes Sylvanas had committed, so she joined the horde rebellion against her, but the siege was not so much a siege as she thought it would be. She does not do too much adventuring anymore.\n",

You will also notice however, that he is heavier than most male pandaren. His big belly is round like a ball of dough, soft like one too. Despite this appearance, there is a sturdy look to it, as if there is indeed a good amount of strength hidden under all that soft fur. Jung goes around shirtless most of the time, proudly displaying his bare belly for all to see.\n\nExcept for his brown and white fur, Jung has no hair on his head or face. Many compare him to an over-sized cub, which some would describe as fitting for his personality. His attire generally consists of shorts, sandals, and a rope belt of some sort. His dark blue eyes typically have a warm and friendly look. \n\nJung is normally an easy-going, somewhat bubbly pandaren. He always tries to be polite, but when he gets agitated he tends to act rather bratty . He is also a frequent crier, whether it be due to fear, sadness, or even happiness Jung cannot help but wear his emotions on his bare belly. Jung has a slight stutter, he will usually stutter a word or two in a sentence. \n",

Hoping that he can change, his parents finally kicked him out of their home, forcing the young pandaren to make a life for himself outside the valley.\n\nNow all Jung wants to do is train to act as a protector to others. When it comes to practicing as a monk he uses a style that combines elements of the tiger and ox styles. Jung hopes to eventually continue on his family's sauce-making business, before that however he must prove to his parents that he can change his ways.",

He is pretty much his idol and Magilokk strives to be just like the Thrall of old.\n\nName Pronounced: MAH-Gih-Lock\n\nBackstory: \n\nAfter the Second War, Magilokk was born into the Frostwolf Village. A fateful day would one day come during his adolescence when Thrall would come to the village for the first time. He would leave and return to the village, telling stories of his conquests on freeing the Orcish slaves. Even bringing back some great heroes who were held in captivity, like Varok Saurfang, Grommash Hellscream, and Eitrigg. \n\nOne unfortunate day, news would reach the village that Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer had been slain on the field of battle. Thrall was named Warchief of the New Horde. Magilokk was eager to follow him into battle to exact vengeance upon the Alliance. Thrall then kindly lectured him about the dangers of having a vengeful heart, and that until he learned what it meant to truly be an Orc, he was not ready to join the Horde.\n\nAt first Magilokk was disheartened, but some time after, he put Thrall's words to heart and became inspired to learn the ways of the elements. And so, he requested training under the village's Farseer, Drek'thar. \n\nYears of training would pass by until Magilokk was finally wise and strong enough to join the Horde. With excitement and pride, Magilokk serves the mighty faction, with Thrall as his role model. Do not fight for vengeance or with hatred. Fight for home, and family. This is what it truly means to be an Orc.\n\nPersonality:\n\nMagilokk believes that the nonviolent way of solving an issue is the best way. He would show kindness to everyone he meets, including his enemies. However, he is fierce and deadly on the battlefield, and strikes down his enemies without mercy. He believes strongly in defending the lands of his people, the Horde. Any who dare threaten it, he would become their bane.\n\nMagilokk isn't very receptive to those who act a fool near him, and tends to be grumpy towards people like that. He is a peaceful Orc, but he loves battle just like any other Orc, and will eagerly fight in the front lines to protect his people. He takes pride in being a fighter in the Horde, and will always stay true to Thrall's Horde.\n\nThose who threaten the values that he lives by, beware. Magilokk is coming for you.\n\nAttracted to: Orcs/Maghar, Trolls/Zandalari, Goblins\n\nSocial Media: \n\n@zzapee on Twitter/Instagram\n@MexPotaChips on Facebook",

He stood proudly with a gaze that would make even the strongest of warriors’ waver with caution. He walked with an exuberant amount of confidence and pride almost tripping over the edge of cocky to some. Heavy plate armor made his presence known to those within hearing distance for he was not a being who hid himself away from questioning onlookers, he knew his worth and was unashamed in showing it.{/col}{/h1}\n\n\n{h2:c}{col:ff0c00}Features of Toris{/col}{/h2}\n\n\n{h1}{col:00ecff}His features looked that of most of his Sin'doreri brethren; muscular with a dash of grace. His eyes on the other hand was what set him apart from most; they were Blue with an Orangen hue iris and pupil with a faint luminescent glow to those intense orbs. Only those close to him know the reasoning behind this oddity. His hair was dark and long, having only a partial bulk of his hair crudely tied into a tail with a simple leather band. Like most of his kind his body was decorated with enchanted golden tattoos to represent his belief and values, while also blessing him with the extra strength needed to smite down his foes, the golden ink traveled along his chest and abdomen.{/col}{/h1}\n\n\n{h1}{col:00f3ff}His tone was pleasant and friendly, but on a dime could turn into that of a commanding sort if warranted. He didn’t carry the classic accent of the Sin'dorei, it was more… Proper, closely related to that of a Human, or a Dwarven man. Another strange trait that only those close to him would understand why that was.{/h1}\n\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/826505489914265666/857733705644376074/NIorONcpL_b3kJXGETVobcRckj9P3Suz_D-xC-0pqnc.jpg*Toris in his Glory.} (Reference)\n{link*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/826505489914265666/857733718470950942/DMq3ihDXkAAtmhC.jpg*Toris looking over his Victory.} (Reference)\n\n",

Numerous pouches, trinkets and blades adorned the broad belt that hung from his waist and quickly identified him as a both a War Shaman and a Mystic. Nicks and scorch marks mar the old rough iron shield and axe he carried and it was clear they were as much for utility as they were for intimidating his enemies...as Absolutely nothing about his appearance or aura suggested a timid Orc.\n\nThe calm veneer of practicality that comes from long years living on the cold unforgiving landscape of his home glossed over the amusingly foul mouthed core of an Orc whose tie to the elements seemed to directly affect his personality in times of stress or excitement.

Dressed not in her peoples style of garb but in clothing aligning more with the Tauren and the Horde..  Thigh guards and shin guards with leather buckle.  A scant padded vest adorned with black eagles feathers and bone ribbing upon the sides to protect the ribs.  Each piece of padded armor armor was somewhat decorative in the effigy you would expect to adorn a Tauren's armor..If they were a Pandaren. Her waist was wrapped in a thick belt with a leaf and rope drapes.\n\nHardly typical for a Pandaren.  But she seemed to have an appreciation for aspects of the culture of the clothes she wore.  Despite being obviously martially trained by the Pandaren in their arts.  A very curious combination for one of her kind.  However it seems in direct contrast to the attitude she carries which is a vibrant lust for life that edges onto the hedonistic and violently aggressive.  Fighting, drinking, engaging in every act she can partake in that satisfies her desire to feel alive.\n\nThe astute of the mind can probably see that this kind of behavior ties into something in her past that she experienced, however what that is remains yet to be discovered. She also seems to fight and act beyond her years.\n\n(It's a work in progress and I need to continue working on it.

						["TX"] = "Krelemar was born into a lowborn family within Silvermoon City. His younger days were filled with hard labor trying to put food on the table for his family. As a child he would work along side his father moving trade goods in The Bazaar, while his mother was a tailorer creating the clothing and robes of the common people within the city. At an early age he realized the social dynamics of Silvermoon City and began to desire to better his standing within his homeland.\n\nWhen Krelemar was of age, he joined the Silvermoon Guard. He noticed that those within the military castes were treated far better than those of the civilians. While he enjoyed the benefits of serving under the guard, his desire for more grew as time went on. Krelemar would continue to train and hone his martial skills while still performing his duties as one of the guards protecting the city and keeping order.\n\nWhen the shattering of the Sunwell happened, Krelemar was one of the lucky few to survive the whole ordeal. Unfortunateley, his parents were not so lucky and fell during the chaos. He was able to eke out a living continuing his service but wanted to train even harder and gain more power and standing within Blood-Elven society.\n\nWhen M'uru was captured and contained within the Sunwell he heard about the Order of Blood-Knights that were a new military faction being created. Day and night, Krelemar would train his fighting skills until he was one of the notable ones that were suggested to go through the trials of becoming a Blood-Knight. He knew about the stigmatism and the negative views of the Blood-Knight Order and how they were forcefully taking the powers of the Light, but paid them no mind as they were seen as an elite fighting force that demanded respect and honor. Krelemar accepted the initiation without hesitance knowing that his struggles were just about to begin.\n\nHe was fortunate enough to have a Blood-Knight mentor that saw potential in him and inducted him as a Knight-Squire. For several years he trained mentally and physically to weild the powers of the Light, but with some repercussions that would inevitably follow him to this day. Krelemar would suffer from headaches occasionally due to the unethical methods of how he obtained his usage of the light. While others succumbed into madness in the process, he channeled that struggle through his newly obtained mental fortitude with an iron resolution. He liked the strict codes and discipline that was being molded into him which defined the other Knight-squires like him. The madness still resides in him because of the apprehensive way he obtained his magical skills, but it manifested as a personality trait in which he is undeniably contempt of others. He tries to keep the insanity in check, but one can easily hear in his voice the strain he has holding back from being aggressive or outright lunatic.\n\nThe years of trials felt like an eternity to him but he was able to succeed and became a full fledged Blood-Knight. After reaching this milestone he thought his inner desire for power would be satiated but it has only morphed into something else. He holds the strict codes and tenants of the Order in high value and seeks to further their renown through his own deeds. When told he would need to travel the world to lend his skills in places that direly needs them, he did so almost eagerly. Looking to make a name for himself and for the Blood-Knights, he now seeks battles to prove why him and his Order should be feared by those who would be unlucky to have his sword aimed at them.",

Two large tusks protrude from each side of his mouth and they too ar adorned in gold, when he speaks the fact that his tongue is forked and eat half is pierced can be seen, though this does not impead his speech.\n\nRael's physique is kept in pique conditions, he trains regularly, and often with his hunting companions.

The latter being if someone threatens any of his animal companions, or those he has grown loyal to. On the other hand he is always striving to push people to be their best! He will offer encouraging words and if he see someone struggling he will reach down and pick them up, running with them to the finishline if he has to.

And like his father before him he dedicated himself to Gonk the Loa od the Hunt. He was gifted with a Dire horn as his first hunting companion, and raised him, hand reared him and perfected his husbandry to provide for his partner. As he grew he learned all the ins and outs of being a beast handler, he was sent to Warbeast Krall to continue his persuit of becoming a Predator, an expert hunter. During his time there a speaker of the Horde came to Zandalar, and following them was war. Being a capable warrior he was chosen by the newly named Queen to go to Orgimmar and represent his people.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{icon:ability_dualwield:25}{col:ffd259}Rules of Engagement(Combat rules){/col}{icon:ability_dualwield:25}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffd259}†HP: Both players got 5/5 HP\n†Combat rolls: /roll 10 is preferred, ties are rerolled, higher score deals damage.\n†Post order: Roll for Initiative, Emote, Roll, Repeated the last two steps until combat ends.\n†Pets: Pets are included in players attack but do not add damage, just flavor!\n†Rule of 3+: If you beat a roll by 3+ you deal extra damage.{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\Arch-Race-ZandalariBIG:256:512}\n\n",

After Ashlin was born her father agreed to keep her and take care of her but her father could not stop thinking about how she would be treated by other orc's if they found out her being a half breed, even her half mother and half sister so she hidden her daughter away until she was older told her mate and daughter a lie so they would hate him and never want anything to do with him then raised Ashlin alone. When Ashlin was about teenager she never followed the path of the warrior or the path of the shaman she followed her own path using a dagger and blades of different kinds she even started creating her own weapons to use around other people who threaten her but thats is when a dark figure moved in to greet Ashlin and gave her a new path a path of power and and magic Ashlin never really liked Magic but she did want to be stronger like her father. Ashlin was about to take the invite the dark figure was going to offer her until her father grabbed her and pulled her away scolding her and giving her a long serous talk before bedtime for her, later that night Ashlin sneaked off to head to where the dark figure said to go and thats when she found out it was a Sub branch from \"the shadow council\" before she could get out they grabbed her and chanted some kind of dark magic inside her soul but before they could finish a blast of flames burst out from where she walked in it was her father and two allies one was her mother and the third was some Orc warrior. They rushed in and attacked the members of the cult slaying them left and right as her father pulls Ashlin out and rushed out back home where she was talked to harshly by both her mother and father as they was not happy with her, by this day she still carries her half breed apperance but instead of hidding it she embraces it but in honor of her father and mother she does not let anyone give her shit about it or defind who she is by what she carries in blood.\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n{img:Interface\\TALENTFRAME\\bg-rogue-subtlety:512:512}\nBy when she is an adult she has taken the role of an Assassin with \"special\" abilitys with in the shadows she has used her skills and the gear she has created into helping her with her jobs and work Assignments she is very creative and talented for an assassin she has attempted to rejoin her half sister and half mother in telling them what happend to her father but she never really got the chance to do to.

The dumplings are filled with cabbage and mushrooms and there are ten (10) of them on each plate. \n- A teacup containing one six-sided dice is to be used\n- The goal of the game is to eat three plates of dumplings (A best of five)\n\n{h3:c}How a Game Works{/h3}\n\n- After the plates are set up, the players first determine who rolls first. This is done by...Rolling. However they will only be rolling one of the dice for this round. Gei will typically let his opponent roll first. Players will use /roll 1-6 in this case. The higher number gets to go first. If both players roll the same number, they must both roll again.\n\n- The player who got the higher roll now gets to actually roll and the game starts. Now the real game begins! The player who rolled the highest number now does /roll 6 again, followed by the opponent. The player who got the higher roll now gets to eat a plate of dumplings from the circle. They must eat all ten dumplings.\n\n- The players then roll again in the same fashion, the goal being of course to eat at least three plates of dumplings. The first player to eat three plates wins the game. Players will keep playing until one of them eats three plates.\n\n- In the event that both players roll the same number, a belching contest must be held. Each player will drink a small bottle of plum juice, after which they will see who can do the biggest belch. This is done simply by /roll. The higher number results in the winner being able to eat the plate of dumplings.\n\n",

He spent a large majority of his life growing up in the orphanage in Silvermoon City.\n\nGrowing up, he was constantly bruted and bullied by the other High Elves for not being as strong as them, often being the subject of cruel torment by the other children, One year, everything in Anivastin's world changed when a Paladin by the name of Balthaneus Godspire took him out for Children's Week. At the end of the week, Anivastin was adopted into his care.\n\nFor years following, Anivastin trained under Godspire in the ways of The Light, Taking campaigns serving Lordaeron made him battle hardened and formidable. After the destruction of The Sunwell, Anivastin was among the second to be knighted as a Blood Knight, staying behind to help with the reconstruction of Silvermoon instead of following Kael'Thas through the Dark Portal into Outlands. Godspire and Anivastin, instead, roamed the lands looking for new sources of energy to qualm their people's thirst for magic.\n\nAnivastin was in the city of Silvermoon the day that Kael'Thalas laid seige to it in order to retake the Naaru, M'uru. Anivastin defiantly stood his ground in combat with The Legion. During combat, however, his armor was shattered and his torso was sliced open, leaving him gravely wounded. He stumbled to the Shephard's Gate and collapsed. Godspire, who was returning from Dalaran, rushed into the pillaged city and found Anivastin. He saved his life a second time, pulling him to safety and healing his wounds.\n\nGodspire and Anivastin laid low for the time being, waiting for Anivastin's wounds to heal and waiting on new orders from Lady Liadrin. When the Northrend campaign broke out, Balthaneus Godspire was hand-picked to fight the Lich in the Northern territory. Anivastin begged to leave with and fight alongside his master, but was declined. Godspire told Anivastin it was too dangerous. He has almost lost him once, he did not want to lose him again. Balthaneus was struck down in combat and raised into a Lich three months later.\n\nUpon recieving the news about his teacher, Anivastin took off to Northrend to confront King Arthas. While he never made it to the storming of Icecrown Citadel, he did, however, slay many of the Lich King's army, taking comfort in putting the bodies of the fallen in their final resting place. During a routine patrol in Zul'Drak, however, he did find the reanimated body of Godspire. A great fight broke out between student and teacher. The battle not only scarred Anivastin physically, but mentally as well after having to lay the broken corpse of his best friend to rest. He takes up the name \"Godspire\", in memory of the man and the legacy that spared him.\n\nWith no real family and his mentor and companion gone, Anivastin roams the world in persuit of becoming a better paladin. To him, the only real thing he can believe in is The Light, and there is nothing, object or person wise, he holds closer than his teachings... and drive to eradicate evil from the world.",

He has a suprisingly sharp wit for a warrior and is usually quick with a joke.  While off of the battlefield, he is usually fairly laid back, often found relaxing, smoking hookah, and enjoying his favorite beer.  However, he takes his duties as a soldier very seriously, and is extremely no-nonsense when it comes to his duties as both a warrior and a leader.  Having spent most of his life as a nomad, wandering Azeroth, he can be extremely shy and sometimes awkward around people, even those he's closest to.  He can be somewhat standoffish and rarely approaches others unless he has business with them, but is more than happy to engage new people and is generally very polite and friendly.\n\nThough he tries to maintain this calm and mellow persona, sometimes his temper can give way to a rage.  He has a strong affinity for all non-aggressive animals and will go out of his way to see that they are not harmed.  The needless slaughter of these beasts is a sure fire way to get on his bad side.  It is also this love for animals that has earned him a trusted place amongst many beasts on Azeroth, many of which are often found at his side as companions or mounts.\n\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmcAUWT8AHM*Theme: Grandson - Bury Me Face Down}",

Upon being hit by sunlight, they appear like swirls of dark amber. She has an olive complexation but used to be more fair in her younger years. Her face is angled, yet with hints of softness. Despite her years in the military, her face remains unscarred, or perhaps it could be her amazing make up skills? Her black hair is thick and wavey, differing from her shorter straight hair she had several years ago. She is of average height for a human woman. She has a slim figure with an average bust and hips. Upon closer inspection, her body is riddled with scars from her years in Pandaria. \n\n                                                      History\n\nAfter a long and successful career in the military, Ella Finch was rewarded with the title of \"baroness\" and a parcel of land in Redridge Mountains. While court politics differ from the military politics she was used to dealing with, she is slowly getting used to her new life. \n\nElla was orphaned a young child during the first war.  She was eventually picked up by a young couple living in Redridge and she lived with them for many years. She learned tailoring from her adopted mother and hunting from her adopted father. It was humble living with little luxuries but she was happy. A raid by the horde killed her newfound family when she was only 16. Angered, she vowed revenge against the Horde and joined the military. She eventually climbed up the ranks as a skillful assassin and eventually became a lieutenant commander. She lead many sucessful battles against the Horde and quickly became a favorite among most people of Redridge. Her careful planning and charm earned her the favor of a highlord but the top brass' jealously. She eventually messed up on a mission, causing the deaths of hundreds of alliance soldiers including most of her friends. This resulted in top alliance military officers to call for her termination; some even called for her execution over her poor judgement. \n\nShe managed to pull her connections with the highlord to retire (step down) from service in exchange for nobility and a small parcel of land. This ensured her protection from the military's wrath. While she enjoys the lavish parties (the food in particular), her crass behavior and low born stature has gained the disrepect of many nobles. Some nobles even resort to blackmailing her in order to humilate her by doing servant work. Besides a few acres of land, she didn't really get much and is relatively poor despite her title. She has resorted to doing some sketchy jobs including poaching and prostitution. This caused her to rethink her decision of becoming a noble. However if she leaves the life of nobility, that might put her at risk of immediate execution by the Stormwind military. She misses aspects of her old life and she constantly sneaks away from the castle to do mercenary work. She doesn't want to give both lives up and currently seeks a balance between the two. She wants to remain a noble, but she will do things her own way. \n",

Lips painted in darker rouge to decorate the expression they displayed so frequently. A touch of charcoal eyeshadow to help make those glowing corrupted eyes pop.\n\nHer body though short was no less seductive and alluring than the remainder of her kin. For one wanting measurements they would find them to be 40B - 20W - 35H. Each step taken caused her chest to bounce just enough if she so demanded it.

Daughter of a servant mother who died in childbirth, Ari grew up raised harshly by the rest of her family. Her identity was swept under the rug for some time, until her father pushed to legitimize her under the Dawnreaver name when she was fourteen years old.\n\nNow a noble like her brothers and sisters, Ari was however faced with the difficult reality that the public knew of her original status as a bastard child, and therefore she would be most likely frowned upon by the vast public scene of Silvermoon's nobility. This did not, however, change the fact that the girl had determination.\n\nNot so long ago, Ariandrys was settled by her family in a marriage arrangement with a noble house of Suramar, wedded with their youngest son named Arleaux. Neither of them had any say in the matter, and it is most likely that they do not know each other very well.\n\nThe two were soon handed a small trading company to be the head of, of which most of the credit is handed to Arleaux. Ari has been seen as a trophy wife eversince the wedding, and her public status has not changed since then.\n\nOutside of official business, Ari is seen as a friend of the people of all classes, spending time out in the open world to meet new people and make new friendships. She always makes sure to help those in need, and seems to go out of her way to do just that.\n\nSome whispers in the wind may speak of Ariandrys treading through the slums of many large cities, speaking with less than respectable, or simply suspicious individuals. However, no proof of it being really her has been delivered to the public, and these rumors have had a tendency to die out, being brushed away as simple gossip and made up scandals to bring ill views on the Vaudrin name.\n",

Were it not for those honeyed eyes and short pointed ears, the guards of Horde cities would be quick to take her to the chopping block. Instead, her half-blood seems to earn her glares of disapproval, especially amongst her pure-blooded Sin'dorei kin.\n\nWhat she lacked in the standards of elven beauty, she made up for with her human traits. Born of a wastewander mother and living her life amongst a wandering caravan of merchants in Uldum, her smooth, flawless skin has adapted to the harsh desert sun, taking on a soft light brown complexion. Atop her head sits a thick mane of silky black hair that falls to her shoulders, framing her angular face. Below her long, thin brows lay her soft golden hues, her lids always painted smokey black, and lined with a thick plume of lashes. The half-elf possesses a pronounced nose, the right nostril pierced with a single golden stud. Below her nose lies her full, pouty lips. Though they are hardly ever pouting, rather upturned into a charming little smile. Her ears are mostly hidden beneath the curtain of thick hair on her head, the points just barely peeking through, the lobes pierced with large gold hoops.\n\nThe half-elf's form is slender, but by no means to the degree of her elven sisters. From her small shoulders hangs her gently toned arms, her tanned flesh tattooed from shoulder to hand with a mix of arcane runes and Tol'viri heiroglyphs, all of which glow a vibrant mana blue. Shey-Ra possesses a shapely hourglass form, adorning a generous bust upon her chest, with a flat toned abdomen just below. Her haunches support a supple backside, her legs trimmed with a fair bit of muscle definition from her time sprinting through the various traps that riddle the various ruins she finds herself in.\n\nShey-Ra is a friendly, curious soul by nature, greeting all with a warm smile and a bow of her head. Since leaving the sands of Uldum behind, she has been eager to meet the various races of Azeroth and learn of their culture. She is a merchant by trade, and will always be looking for something to sell or barter. Though do not let her friendly smile and sultry speech fool you. It's best to recount your coin after speaking with her.\n\nShey-Ra's attire is best suited for the harsh deserts of Kalimdor. Layers of cloths and Tol'viri silks are draped and tied around her form, the fabrics tattered and frayed from the sandstorms they've indured. An embossed leather tunic dresses her torso, being the only 'real' source of protection on the spell-thief's form, leaving her incredibly light on her feet. Her belt holds an abundance of leather bags, scrolls, and corked vials seated upon it, along with a drab brown tapestry around her hips that spans down her backside to her ankles. A baggy pair of trousers dress her legs, stitched over a dozen times to patch holes in the fabric. Her calves are kept wrapped with thick bandages, her feet dressed with simple cloth sandals. Despite her dull, sandy attire, the spell-thief adorns some luxurious items. A golden usekh dresses her small shoulders, resting across her bust. The collar is engraved with distinct Tol'viri heiroglyphs and patterns. Her tattooed biceps are wrapped with matching cuffs, fashioned in the likeness of vipers curling around her arms. Jingling gold chains dangle from bracers around her wrists, linking to bands that dress her middle fingers.\n\nThe swords upon her hips are Tol'viri by craft, khopeshes; swords that served more like hatchets than a traditional sword. The blades themselves looked as if they were carved from a rich sky blue topaz, the flats glimmering like the stars in the night sky. The blades are crafted from a rare metal, appropriately named 'star metal', from a comet that crashed into the sands many years ago. The Tol'viri thought this a gift from the Titans, and forged various rare, luxurious jewels for the king and his mates, as well as weapons for his finest generals using the precious star metal. Such weapons, including a twin pair of khopeshes gifted to General Zahim. When he died, he was buried with the blades in his tomb, long forgotten in the sands, until a certain sticky-fingered half-elf krept her way through the tomb and plucked them from the general's decrepit hands. \n\n\n                          {icon:inv_tailoring_uncommoncloth:25}The Tapestry {icon:inv_tailoring_uncommoncloth:25} A beautiful handwoven tapestry depicting imagery of Uldum lies at the woman's feet, lined with a variety of wares that range across Azeroth.\n\n-Numerous spices, coffee grinds, and pipe tobacco flavors.\n-A cluster of potions ranging in colors and sizes.\n- Various silks and cloths of racial make. \n-Enchanted whetstones.\n-Several alchemical herbs and fungi.\n-Varying bottles of cologne, musks, and perfumes.\n-Rings, necklaces, anklets, bracelets, and collars of varying racial motifs. \n-A large macaw in a cage.\n-One use offensive and defensive scrolls.\n-Stacks of elven literature.\n-Dream catchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Handsome in a savage way his tattooed face seems locked in a perpetual pendulum between grimace and amused smile as if the world he sees around him confuses, disgusts and amuses him in equal parts. Possessed of a twisted and cruel wit, his sense of humor seems to flow from the dark places of his past. Charming in the way a serpent is, his manners and decorum seem to come and go as the mood strikes him or as need dictates. A coarse guttural voice seemed to hiss out from between razor sharp teeth and rune inscribed tusks, speaking with a bewildering confidence that betrayed the whirling vortex of barely contained mania beneath. A slow and confident..yet syncopated gait seems to allude to this as well, as he exudes the aura of a Troll who has seen and done unspeakable things for his people and has come out the better for it...or at least as he sees it.\n\nDressed in frayed robes of black silks, with gold and red accents hung with trinkets..long sleeves and high shoulders are the order of the day, as they primarily conceal the lines of ritual brands and burn scars that cover his coal black skin. A crudely made spell blade and macabre fetish fashioned from a mummified hand hang from a waist that was wrapped in tarnished golden hooked chains intertwined with vials and little carved fetishes. A billowing cloak of silk and chained together sections of..what appears to be stretched..leather..hangs from his broad shoulders, the grizzly clinking drape offering a muted glimpse into the mind of a madman whose chaotic aura seemed to drift from him like a smoking brazier with every step.\n\nAs a recent transplant into the ranks of the Horde, he seems to have adapted fairly well, with only a few..minor..incidents. A person would be hard pressed to guess what exactly motivates the wayward Zandalari to do what he does, but one quickly realizes that when dealing with him,  good, evil and even normality are relative terms.{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c}{link*https://tinyurl.com/khahazansfw*SFW art of Kha'hazan}{/col}{/h1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c} {col:ed1314}/c/{/col}{/h1}\n{/col}\n\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:ff162f} If you wish to see *ALL* *nudge nudge wink wink* artwork of this character, just ask.

In Frosfire, Dreanor, her mother was a nomad of sorts-a female orc of the Frostwolf Clan who chose adventure in a young life.\nRakonna's mother was...taken advantage of by other traveling Orc's. She was kept as a slave until she was with child. With Rakonna.\n\nWhen the male orc's found out, they sold her off to Ogre's and she was put to work till the day she gave birth to Rakonna... She only had a few moments with her new born child before the Ogre's snatched her away and raised her in a dark cell.\n\nShe was never given a name, not yet...\n\nFor the first 7 years of her life, Rakonna was 'taught' how to speak by one Ogre, in order to understand commands by her new masters. She spoke in a broken language, she poke like an Ogre. And for the next 2 years she worked in the slag mines, surrounded by fire and hot coal and the cries of other slaves. She understood this was not how someone was supposed to be treated...But she never spoke against it in fear of beatings.\n\nShe always wore a chain collar around her neck because the first time she learned she was a slave, and there was a world outside, she tried to run. She was only 9 so she was caught easily by an Ogre Mage. And ever since she was put on a leash like a dog. The iron collar wore down the skin on her neck so it made for bad scarring from below her chin down to her collar bone.\n\nRakonna loathed being a slave, she cried almost every night when she was allowed what little sleep she had. She was just a child, small and defenseless. Barely spoke a word because she didn't know them or was too afraid.\n\n\nOne night, on a terribly cold winter eve, Rakonna was suddenly woken up from her sleep as she heard screaming and shouting. Ogre's shouting.\nIt was the Frostwolf clan! They joined forces with the Horde and were raiding the mines, smashing cell doors open and freeing slaves. Dreanei and Orc's alike!\n\nOnce her cell was opened, Rakonna made a run for it, not caring who was shouting at her from behind. She was too scared to stop and look.\n\nShe ran outside. For the first time in her entire life, she felt a breeze...Cold, fresh....Welcoming. It felt like...Home. She stood still for a long moment, letting her bare feet sink into the snow like one would do in warm, soft sand. \nTears fell down her cheeks and she let out a howl, tossing her head back. Her heart was racing in her chest with excitment and joy, falling onto her back on the soft snow... It felt so much better than the small cot made of hay she had in her now former cell.\n\nRakonna closed her eyes and listened to the wind. Her peaceful moment was interrupted by heavy footsteps in the snow, a low voice rumbling. \"What are you doing, little one?\" It was a tall, heavily muscular male Orc with dark skin and a few tattoos on his arms.\nRakonna shot up to her feet and backed away in fear, glaring at him and growling. \"No friend!\" She snapped at him. She was declaring the male orc was an enemy, one like the Ogre's who enslaved her.\nThe male orc simply smiled and sat down in front of her. \"Perhaps not. But I can be.\" He held out his hand, in it were food rations. Bread and meat. \"Eat, little one. You look starved.\"\nRakonna inched forward, growling at the man still as she quickly snatched the food and ate it all in about 10 seconds. She liked the taste of fresh meat and non-molded bread. She let out a huff of ecitement and began grabbing his pockets, looking for more. This earned a laugh from the orc as he took the chance to pick her up, \"I see you liked that!\" Rakonna just let out another huff. \"Hungry. Give.\" This earned another laugh from the orc as he kept a supportive grip on her, holding her like a baby cradled in his arms. \"I know somewhere you can eat a lot more.\"\nRakonna tilted her head, understanding some of his words. \"Nom nom, where?\"\nThe male orc smiled as he walked off with her. \"Home.\"\n\nFor years to come after that night, she was given the name Rakonna. She and her wolf G'anar and Solvera hunted for the clan, and she loved it. Running free in the wilds as she pleased. She wished she could have known her mother... But she knows she is honoring her by living on, to be the best she can be!\n\n{h3:c}And Now Back To The Present!{/h3}\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-ChromieScenario-Chromie-Small:256:128}\n",

Letss sssee....{/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sunlight:700:120}\n{col:fbffae}The day shines bright in a small Shu'halo village tucked away in the Stonetalon Mountains. It shines even brighter for a particular young couple as they gaze down lovingly at their brand new baby girl, their little ray of sunshine, almost literally with her golden fur and straw-blond mane, grinning from ear to ear at her parents.\n\nTo say she was a happy calf would have been an understatement, and the young pair had to always be on their toes, the little rascal constantly getting herself into trouble. As energetic as they come, she ran everywhere she went, bounced when standing in place, and laughed at everything she saw. She was an absolute joy, if her mother and father were to be asked.\n\nSadly it was not to last. In one fateful night, less than a week before her coming-of-age ceremony, everything changed....{/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Darkness:700:128}\n{col:ae8fd1}A concerned mother's voice...\n\n\"Art'eruk, have you seen M'lai? It's getting dark and I'm getting worried, she's usually home by now...\"\n\n\"Sorry T'uleila, I'm afraid I have not. Have you checked by the Strand? I noticed she's been heading that way more and more lately.\"\n\n\"Not yet, I'll get K'inyar and have a look now. Thank you.\"\n\nWithin a few minutes, the couple were on their way to find their daughter. Zoram Strand... It wasn't that far from the village, but you had to negotiate cliffs to get to it, and many of those outcroppings were loose...\n\nThe adults of the village usually didn't have much trouble scaling those cliffs, but almost none of them would attempt it in the dark. They had to hurry, or they would be forced to camp on the Strand, and the normally calm waves that lapped at the shorline became rather intense in the light of Mu'sha.\n\nIt took them longer than they liked in the fading light, but eventually they made it to the last precipice and were able to gaze down tot he sand below and see their beloved daughter laying in the sand, her head as well as an arm at angles they should never be able to go...\n\nT'uleila bursts into tears as K'inyar just stares in shock. Finally he becomes able to tear his eyes away, and notices the creature slowly making its way toward their daughter's body, unable to make out exactly what it was in the failing light. In fear of having to watch his pride and joy devoured by some beast right before his eyes, he leaps from the precipice, his climbing hook held to strike the beast when he landed. He landed just barely too late, the beast's head snapping forward and sinking its teeth into her right shoulder.{/col}\n\n{col:e0e0e0}M'lai raises a hand to feel the two bumps of scar tissue just above her right collar bone, her eyes clouded in memory...\n\n\"Ah, ssssorry, got a bit losst. Let me continue...\"{/col}\n\n{col:ae8fd1}The creature's head remained attached to the young Shu'halo as its body dropped, lifeless as K'inyar's hook ripped through the flesh of its neck, accompanied by the sound of his left leg snapping as he landed. He grabbed its head, throwing it into the sea before the adrenaline wore off and the pain in his leg hit him, dropping him with a gasp, the agony causing him to miss the last tendrils of shadow creeping into the bite.\n\n\"K'inyar! Are you alright?\" the concern in her voice clear.\n\n\"I broke my leg, but the creature is dead.\" As is the pain in his.\n\n\"Hold on, I'm on my way down!\"\n\nEven with her eyes blurred by the tears still flowing from them, she manages to find and grab the rope dangling from the last point they tied it off from. A few moments and she was to the sand, and by her mate's side.\n\n\"Let me have a look... Well, it's definitely broken. We'll have to stay here for the night and hope the waves don't reacah us.\"\n\nThe sea was unnaturally calm that night, and as two pairs of eyes closed in sleep, a younger pair opened...{/col}\n\n{col:e0e0e0}She took a moment to clear her throat, \"I think that isss enough for now, I need a drink...\"{/col}\n\nI -think- it's pretty much done, the rest of the story to be told in actual RP. Some stuff may be changed slightly. Perfection is a journey, not a destination.\n\nSide note: If you're going to stand around chatting OoC, the polite thing to do is move away from the people trying to RP.",

After regaining free will, he went back to his family, who reaccepted him without hesitation, and attempted to live a semi-normal life once again, but the pull of the Ebon Blade was too difficult to avoid, as well as the \"eternal hunger\" that all Death Knights endure. He realized he had to embrace his new life, and fought for Azeroth with his fellow death knights.\n\nAfter the Deathlord assaulted the Sanctum of Light to attempt to raise Tirion, Khazgrim couldn't pretend to be satisfied with the way they led any more. He left active duty and focused on fighting the Legion with the Alliance.\n\nOnce the Legion was defeated, Khazgrim officially left* the Ebon Blade to join Magni Bronzebeard's cause, seeking out ways to heal Azeroth, including gathering Azerite. Denouncing the Fourth War as a waste of time, he argued and fought to divert Azerite away from weaponry back towards where it belonged.\n\nHowever, when Sylvanas attacked and burned down Teldrassil, Khazgrim realized that she was as much of a risk to Azeroth as she was to the Alliance, and thus joined the War of the Thorns to drive the Forsaken out of Darkshore. \n\nOnce Sylvanas denounced the Horde and disappeared, he refocused his efforts back towards Azeroth- just in time for N'Zoth to unleash his visions upon the world. The struggle against N'Zoth's forces was a brutal one, but through the efforts of the champions of the world, Azeroth prevailed. \n\nWhen the fighting came to a conclusion, and a shaky peace treaty was put in place, Khazgrim was left in a predicament. The \"Eternal Hunger\" he feels does not stop for peace. The best he could do was help quell small pockets of fighting and continue to assist Magni.\n\nAnd then the sky tore open. With the pull of the Helm of Domination gone, and Bolvar now fully in control of the Ebon Blade (and no Ner'zhul!) Khazgrim re-entered active Ebon Blade duty to delve into the Shadowlands to fight against Sylvanas... and then disappeared after the initial conflict.\n\nPresumed dead, the Ebon Blade included him in their memorials for the fallen- but no evidence of a body was ever found, only his runeaxe, leading some to believe he's still alive, somewhere.\n\n\nFamily:\nMogruff Frostbeard- Brother\nBrythlin Frostbeard- Sister\nKjeldruf Silverskimmer- Cousin\n\n*The idea that Death Knights can leave the Ebon Blade is somewhat disputed. If you are one who believes they cannot, then Khazgrim just left active duty to help Magni, still chained to the Ebon Blade.",

His horns curve somewhat forward to face towards someone in front of him, and there's a ring on just one that's nearly always there.\n\nSometimes seen in rather flashy garb, but more often just simple clothes. He often  wears a fancy sort of hat on his head that he thinks makes him look rather handsome, but sometimes it'll be clutched in his hand.  He's not often seen with a bag or anything on him, so it doesn't appear he carries much if anything except what might be in a small pouch at his waist, which doesn't look like there's be much more then some coin perhaps.

His stout biceps and leg muscles should speak of a worldly and self-sufficient man, and though he does appear to have respectably broad shoulders and a somewhat wider neck, the notable lack of scarring and other such bodily damage could allude that he doesn't make a living of combat.{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff} Being a rather welcoming and optimistic sort of bear, he'd assuredly greet all but the most palpably bitter sorts with a fond smile. His visage exhibits a harmless, gentle, and contemplative demeanor with his cerulean eyes--each engulfed with their own vertical black stripe--ordinarily tapered in a cool and studious manner. Should neither headdress nor straw hat veil his head, a bed of spiky back-brushed hair would be noticed, as well as a thick, bristly brow and a lengthy, tidily trimmed beard along his jawline. His silken hide is almost entirely dark black in hue, the exceptions being the bright white fur upon his feet, paws, chest, face, and underbelly.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-VindicaarCrystal-LightforgedWarframe:256:128}\n\n{h2:c}Hooks{/h2}{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\n{h3}One may recognize Kai if...{/h3}\n\n{col:ffffff}• They are from Shen-zin Su, particularly the Dai-Lo Farmstead and the Singing Pools.\n\n• They frequently visited Mandori and the Temple of Five Dawns during his training.\n\n• They were among the first to depart from the Wandering Isle to set foot on Pandaria just after its rediscovery.\n\n• They work with or are affiliated with the Earthen Ring, the Champions of Azeroth, and/or the Kui Zhang Society.\n\n• They are a fellow student of the elements and history of Pandaria.\n\n• They are/were a student of the Krasari wavespeaker hermit, Master Jang Yeong-jin.\n\n• They are currently receiving training with one of the Celestial temples, particularly at the Jade Temple.{/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\TALENTFRAME\\bg-monk-mistweaver:256:256}{h2:c}{col:ffffff}External Links{/col}{/h2}{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://twitter.com/jikai1992*Twitter}{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://imgur.com/a/2EcQ27O*Character Art Gallery}{/h3}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\PVP-Banner-Emblem-91:64:64}",

She has a well developed build, with a strong core and fair tone to her whole body. Yet, she maintains that key elven lankiness, which almost seems at odds with her abilities. \n\n    As with many, Exsuai’s skin has been changed to a stained blue color, and her hair has become an equally deep blue. Apart from those changes however, she lacks any notable void taint. \n\n    In terms of appearance, Exsuai is fairly typical for an elf. Pointy nose, pointy jaw, high cheekbones, thin lips and bright eyes. There isn’t much about her face that really stands out. Her age is impossible to tell, due to the lack of fine lines. \n\n    Exsuai’s hair is relatively long, but also well kept. Her hair reaches to the middle of her back, where it’s bound into a loose braid. The braid is always kept behind her back, in order to make sure it’s out of the way. Her hair was once black, but is now a deep blue. \n\n    While somewhat uncharacteristic of a fighter, Exsuai has a rather soft and quiet voice, with some hoarse undertones. Her voice does not seem to carry the strange echo/flange of many void elves, but that doesn’t mean it’s absent.\n {/p}\n\n{h3:c}Skills and armor{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:97dcff}\nExsuai has a rather unusual set of armor, designed to protect virtually everything. Her torso is guarded by a full breastplate with placakart. The armor has a raised collar to guard her neck and deflect strikes away. Pauldrons to protect her sides and upper arms. Full plated gauntlets to guard her hands. \n\nFull leg plates which cover every part of her legs, save for the joints, and full sabatons for her feet. Faulds guard the sides of her thighs and around the hip joints.\n\nThe armor doesn’t appear to have any notable seams to the plating. Parts like the breastplate and arm guards seem to be fully formed over her, with no apparent way of removal. There is likely some magic in play.\n{col:a1d5cc}\n\n\n {/p}\n\n{h3:c}Quick bits{/h3}\nUses magic to boost her strength and reflexes for short periods. Doesn't do it too much to avoid heavy strain.\n\nThe name Exsuai originates from a slured out Exile ",

She is a shadow of her former self.\n\n...you practice dark magic. While she seems to have little desire in delving into the arts herself, many of her family members have been accused of studying necromancy and are well connected to the underworld revolving around black magic.\n\n...you run any business involving security.

Something or other - Point is, he's had to have had some influence in the past. He was haggling with a customer - Or rather, denying said customer a chance to haggle.\n\nIt'd be hard to argue with him. He had such a confident personality - Such a strong face, chisled features. But of course, it'd probably be even harder to follow up on any sort of argument with him as well. Though he wasnt nessecarily intimidating, on the contrary, quite approachable - but he was LARGE.\n\nTaller than most goblins by a full head, and with a musculature that screamed 'Tiny orc' more than anything else. His limbs were titanically muscular, thick and coiled, rippling with strength. His chest, barely covered by a fashionable mini-vest wit ha few dozen silver strips hanging off the front, hung loosely over a powerful set of pectorals and rock hard abdominals.\n\nA thick set of haunches lead down to powerful calves, barely contained by the tall boots he wore.\n\n\n--------\n\n{h2:c}Recent History{/h2}\n\nFalling in love with one Brynzi Trix has not been an easy path for Tywrecks. From every side, new threats seem to emerge with the intent of dragging down their romance - From self-absorbed rat paladins to legalese spewing cartel leaders - But all it has served to do is drive Tywrecks to the absolute breaking point.\n\nAt some point in the recent days - He has snapped. He has become unhinged - And very dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nHas lately taken up the title of Siegecrafter as he works towards making new machines for his new guild, Rutius Luna.\n\n\n\nMany months of his life memory were erased when a malignant, anima-infused parasite was eradicated from his body.\n\n--------\n\n{h2:r}The Wrecks Entertainography{/h2}\n\n\n{h3}Films{/h3}\n- Rockin Seas;\nA teen drama about an underappreciated musical genius and his heartfelt journey to win a battle of the bands-style competition on a cruise junker, by employing classic goblin ingenuity and a mind controlling musical note. Tywrecks played the tough and nasty bully Biff Tuffscrew, at the age of 17.\n\n- Brake The Law: Origins;\nIn this prequel to the Brake The Law series of 'law' thrillers, Brake Punchlots, Lieutenant of the Undermine Law Enforcement Squad, gets his first ever assignment; RESCUE THE TRADE PRINCE'S PET BOAR. Tywrecks was given the lead roll of a young Brake Punchlots, age 20.\n\n- Shredd;\nA political commentary film criticizing the pro-environment fuel-alternative movement that was growing in goblin society until Gallywix made the statement that there's no money in it, 'So cut dat out.' The film was lazily produced, excessively on the nose, but is seen by some critics as an 'artsy' reel. Tywrecks played a variety of characters that would appear, drop a line of wisdom, and then dissapear in a burst of flames.\n\n\n{h3:r}Advertising{/h3}\n\n- The 'face' of Old Stank spiced body powder, known for staring directly at the target audience and speaking about the product in a fairly provocative and inspiring way.\n-  Poster Model for Scourban Authentic Moth-Chewed Jeans and accessories. \n\n\n{h3}Modeling{/h3}\n\n- Runway Model for Scourban Authentic Moth-Chewed Jeans and accessories.\n- Calendar model for Flickwidth Calendars, (Firegob Edition, Adventurers Edition, and Stay-at-home reasonably-successful Dad edition)\n- Cover model for gaUB~ fashion magazine, as one of the seven xtra-thick and muscular male models they hired for each issue.\n\n{h3:r}Music{/h3}\n\n- Brieft stint as the lead singer of TriBard, was removed after four months due to legal issues and repeated brawls with booking agents.\n\n{h3}Mature Dealings{/h3}\n\n-Several low production values films alongside Tiffaline Twirlytails, a very 'Overenhanced' goblin actress.\n-Several rumors persist that Tywrecks participated in the trials of experimental enhancement procedures...",

First one to stand, weapon in hand, never hesitant to say he will fight. He has seen the rise and fall of many a Warchief, the complete sundering of lands and countless lives lost. Having stood axe to axe with the toughest, bravest and best men and women of his time, he knows what it means to be a conqueror. Never has he been shy from the hellish gore of warfare, the splintering of wood, shattering of steel, the rivers of blood combined with all of the fire, oil, smoke, screams and more. Such is the reason Kadugg the Red upholds fierce patriotism and traditional values of his kin. Some may see him as overzealous while others raise their axes in howling cheer. Whatever the case may be, he has not, and will not, abandon the ways of his ancestors.\n\nIn current time his appearance can only be called handsome by not of traditional orcish society but true warrior culture. A burly frame marred by extensive scarring, tattooing, piercings and a couple of burns. His face flat, skull broad, nose up-pushed and smushed. A tusk clasped by iron to save, a ring hanging from the septum, ears lined with hoops.  There are at least eight braids of hair, each denoting a feat of strength likely in times of great peril during wartime merriment. The elder smells of a smokehouse and a cologne of slight spice. Like thunder within a chasm, the earth trembles with the old soldier's howl that strikes terrible fear into the hearts and minds of his enemies. As is the same with others of like proclivities when shoulder to shoulder of the mighty Warsong. Though conversationally it is much more tame. \n\nCalled 'Red' or 'the Red', this title issued to Kadugg simply by way of his die-hard loyalism to the Horde and the amount of blood from various species he'd be covered in when battles were done and over.\n\nBlood and Honor, for the Horde!{/col}\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAhlAy7wl-o*Lok'tar Ogar!}\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGICON-BLACKROCKSPIRE:256:256}\n\n{link*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oEwU3F62no*Adding Heads to the Pile}\n{link*https://abandoforcs.bandcamp.com/album/march-of-the-gore-stained-axe-tribe*March of the Gore-Stained Axe Tribe}\n\n\n\n{col:ff000a}Rumors, Miscellaneous and History:\n\nA guerilla warfare specialist, taught by the Kaldorei over many skirmishes simply by observing. Yet a wolf rider, raider, front line berserker leading charges or flanking the enemy.\n\nAlways holding a respect for his enemy.\n\nOnce killed ten humans in Hillsbrad with his bare hands before savagely beating another five to death with just one of the men's arms.\n\nTurned the tables on a Sayaad and was the one to seduce her.\n\nLet forth a mighty roar that brought about the unconditional surrender of a would be Alliance attack in Pandaria.\n\nDuring intense engagements with Alliance forces in the barren desert, three orcs were carried upon gramp's back to safety. Only one of the wounded survived.\n\nSaid to not have a strict orientation, to quote: \"I am too old to care.\"\nThose with more than one set of genitalia are assumed to be cursed, avoided and shunned. \n\nHas yet to show any grey in his hair despite being an elder warrior.\n\nOpenly uncaring of his dislike and contempt of the youth.. Bold in his stating of position of opinions. The current Horde climate being too soft, too inclusive, too tolerant. Believing many a proud orc are rolling in their graves in angry embarrassment due how the Horde and it's peoples have become.\n\nPrefering logic, reason, honor and tradition over superstition, insanity and stupidity.\n\nFather to many a bastard son and daughter.\n\nAdamant in the belief that all should pull their weight within the Horde. Without purpose, without benefit, there is no place for one within it.\n\nNever struck an enemy in the back. Never struck down an unarmed combatant.\n\nSaid to be impossible to intimidate and die, having fell in glorious combat and awoke in a pile of bodies on the death wagon. Saying that the spirits of his ancestors did not want him just yet.\n\nThat one perpetually grumpy old timer that continues to outlive everybody, carting his giant steel balls around in a wheelbarrow like the equivalent of a fuckin' WWII veteran who stormed Omaha Beach. Having in fact done very similar during many a campaign, including coming through that infamous portal within The Black Morass.\n\nThe most bad ass orc you've never heard of or just a common traditionalist warrior of old. One thing is fact: Kadugg exudes BDE - Big Dad Energy. Still within his prime and not showing a sign of slowing down any time soon.{/col}\n\n",

A gnome born and raised in Dun Morogh to loving parents who did their best make her upbringing a pleasant one. Unsurprisingly, her life would be anything but. \n\nWhen Fizzy was an infant, she had often become fixated with flames, matches, campfires and any other sort of open flame. One night, in her family home in the dead of winter, she had been put to bed and woken up to a grumbling noise erupting from the fireplace. She had gotten out of bed to slowly creep into the sitting room, fearful of the hazy purple glow emitting in the darkness. And when her head peeked around the corner she was blown back by an aggressive force of energy. She cowered in fear, trembling on the floor until a strange cold presence made itself known to the child. A voidcaller, a creature glowing with a purple hue had stretched it's tendril like hand out to the gnome and hissed at her as if it were trying to speak. This was the first of many rendezvous' the child would have with demons. The voidcaller would be the child's imaginary friend for years to come, until Fizzy was much older. At sixteen years old, Fizzy had become so infatuated with the power the demon imbued, she decided that she needed to satisfy the craving for such dark powers..\n\nToday Fizzy Embertwist studies dark magic with a powerful organization stationed in an unknown location within Northrend. She was picked up as a recruit in Stormwind and began working as an apprentice for a highly knowledgable and yet completely obnoxious warlock, a snobby man who thinks too highly of himself. Fizzy often works alone these days and is currently in the works of being transfered to a new study to complete her orders for clients.\n{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}Things You Should Read{/h1}\n\n\n{p:c}Fizzy stands at roughly 2'11'' and weighs about as much as a medium sized pet dog. But one shouldn't underestimate her size. She's a fire cracker with a bite much worse than her bark. A spark of wicked and chaotic energy pumping constantly through her veins. She's a trickster who enjoys teasing and bullying the taller folks, and uses her bold and yet mysteriously beautiful looks to lure in potential clients and companions.  She's a friendly spirit though, when she's decided upon being friendly that is. If you're on her good side you are likely an ally, a strong business partner, or maybe a love interest. Though the latter is rare. Who would love a psycho like her? Only the brave. And unluckily, the world is anything but brave. Her eyes and hair are stained with a very unnatural vibrant purple wash. To no fault of her own, she stands out due to this phenomenon, but you shouldn't ask her about it, or do.. It's your funeral after all.\n{/p}",

His parents Drekitesh and Gaz'kase Grimfang were both warriors for the clan. They instilled honor and strong ties with other clan members. His father pushed for his training to be a warrior at a young age. When he is not playing with the other childern, was training with his father.{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-DraenorOrc:512:256}\n\n{p:c}Dralgur is a full grown Mag'har orc. Standing a few inches taller then the standrd orc. He has tattoos adoring his scared skin, on both his outer biceps is the Frostwolf Clan insignia. Due to the heavy training that his parents put him though, he his fairly strong. At most time, if he is a group he would listen and watch everyone. Thats is his way of trying to know who you are, if you speak to him he will talk to you. {/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-AncientShamanHeaddress:512:256}\n\n{p:c}During the last few days on Draenor will on patrol for any Lighbound. He came across a elemental that called for his aid. He helped free the elemental and was gifted some of its powers. Unknowing how how to weild such power, the elemental told him to seek out a certain Farseer. After going through the portal at Beastwatch. Dralgur went to seek out this Farseer along with his best friend.\n\nHaving found a place a he could call home and the Farseer he was told to seek out. He begain his path to Shamanism, training each day to prgress his body and mind. He would try to commune with the elements as well and strenghen his connection to them. He forms strong ties with those that he connects with and fiercely loyal to them, while also being very protective of them as well for the Elements. For most time he was favored duel one handed axes, but later favored a hammer and shield or hammer and axe. When on patrol you will always see him scanning the horizon for any threats, he would also stay in the back of the pack. Watching everyone in front of him, when in battle he would pay close attention to his battle mates. He would be often seen running toward to aid one and blocking blows not for him. After he would tend to everyone that was injuried even before himself. If he is order to do something from his upper command he will follow it as long as it is good intentions or goes along with what he follows. When he is in relaxed state you can always find him working on a new carving or totem. He is always willing to lend a ear to either to talk or if you have a problem. He often somtimes speaks words of wisdom when someone is need of it, and encourge them to be better then what they are. He would also go out of his and help anyone that is need.{/p}\n\nOCC\n{link*https://imgur.com/gallery/cN6iVuf*Art of Dralgur}",

Born in Starfall Village to the northwest of the primary trade town, Everlook, she spent much of her childhood learning how to be self-sufficient in order to survive in the unforgiving territory plagued by a nearly perpetual winter. Although she at first considered becoming a priestess of Elune, she quickly revealed a particular knack for abilities such as tracking, hunting and setting traps. Eventually, she even started to show an aptitude for working with and taming animals, which she often used to her advantage during hunts and skirmishes with hostile creatures.\n\nHer mother abandoned her when she was hardly more than a toddler and she, in turn, barely remembers her. Her father, Elrandir, raised her alone, with some occasional support from the other residents of the village. As an expert craftsman in a couple different trades, he trained Alesterra primarily in the art of leatherworking, which she took to rather swiftly.\n\nWhen she was barely more than a century old, one of the local hunters returned to the village with grave news for her. Her father, having departed several days before on his yearly trip to Everlook, had been forced to detour through the wilderness due to especially nasty weather. The severe winds eventually forced him to take shelter in a cave where he was ambushed by a rogue yeti and mauled to death.\n\nHaving been rather close to her father, the news devastated Alesterra to the point that she immediately set off to exact revenge. The spent over a week tracking the yeti until she finally found it a few miles from Everlook. In a blind rage, she attacked the creature head on. She managed to defeat it, but it was a victory that nearly cost her her life. During the battle, the yeti had left deep gouges in her back that would have caused her to bleed to death. However, due to a sheer stroke of luck, a Priestess of Elune found her and brought her to her camp, where she cleaned her wounds and cared for her for a couple of days. Although grateful for the priestess’s help, she was so consumed by her grief that she barely acknowledged her presence most of the time.\n\nWhen she was finally well enough to journey on her own again, she thanked her and quickly set off without another word. Instead of returning to her village, however, she became a wanderer for a short while. She quickly established a circuit running all around northern Kalimdor as a leatherworking trader: one of the many things her father had taught her. Though she desired the path of the priestess like the one that had saved her, she instead settled for this simple traveling lifestyle for a few centuries.\n\nBut eventually, she ran into a cadre of Sentinels and was immediately impressed by them. Seeing a bigger, better purpose, she joined their ranks and from then on  vowed to do whatever was necessary to protect and help others in any way she could, even if only to try to shield them from feeling the type of loss and despair that always lingers within her.{/col}\n",

					["TX"] = "Appearance:\nCauric is a man of rugged appearance, reflecting his brash personality and career choice as a professional soldier. He sports an extremely muscular build when out of his armor, a tanned complexion, and is of above average height for a blood elven male. His short hair is considerably blond, whilst seemingly prone to naturally spike upwards on it's own. His actual eyes are hidden behind a glowing haze akin to any other Thalassian elf from Quel'Thalas, masking what color his pupils might be otherwise.\n\nFeatures portray him as someone who's been through much in his life, leaving his face hardened as a result. On first glance his firm lips are usually tilted downwards in a slight frown, both brows are oft narrowed near permanently and an alert gaze glares about in constant suspicion driven by his past experiences. This facial presentation is what others could easily deem as a blatant scowl in simpler terms. Though quite a few whom choose to interact with the warrior could possibly judge this display as forthcoming enough to approach.\n\nWithout his plate armor, the blood elven fighter has an incredibly refined physique that's entirely due to his innate fitness mixed alongside lifestyle choices such as strict dieting and his decision to spend several hours training on a daily basis. Said training regiment is what gave his muscles their noticeably tempered appearance, the sin'dorei appearing akin to a statue carved from stone with the simplest of motions regularly causing involuntary flexing.\n\nUnfortunately, there's visible scars that mark his flesh. Dagger given blemishes dot his arms and shoulders in a sadistic pattern from what is most certainly the assumed conjecture of him being put through an unwanted torture session for an indeterminable amount of time. Without a shirt on, there is also three prominent scars in the shape of a large animal's claw across his chest and another set down his back. When questioned about this - Cauric will claim he received it from slaying a ferocious bear without weapons and armor.\n\nPersonality: \nThis particular elven man comes across as clumsily heroic and very protective of those he cares about. Even so, he is actually not very bright (but has on a rare occassion shown some cunning and strategy when a situation deems it necessary). He ostensibly fancies himself as an intelligent man, despite his personality traits implying that he overestimates his actual prowess in comprehension. Much, entirely too much, to his own chagrin.\n\nIndeed Cauric truly has a wild, rowdy personality and is always on the lookout for a good fight in contrast to his claims about committing 'Justice's Will'. Still in spite of this reckless nature, the sin'dorei harbors a sense of loyalty to those close to him and acknowledges the value of friendship if asked. Regretfully, only a rare few can see past his rough exterior and somehow manage to fully befriend or earn his respect. With this comes his strong dislike at the idea of being used by someone else, or worse, becoming the victim of betrayl. When this situation happens, he immediately focuses on blatant attempts to get even with those who he considers as having double-crossed him.\n\nWith all the above personality traits in consideration; 'The Pillar of Justice' is normally impulsive, needlessly hostile, immensely loud and swift to leap into action without contemplating any possible risks. As a consequence he frequently comes across as brash, judgemental and exceedingly prideful to everyone else around his person. Furthermore, these same character traits has landed him in lots of trouble far too many times to be counted. However, he is truly dedicated to doing good at his core while oftentimes proving to be a steadfast ally who's willing to help out when called upon.\n\nHis methods, attitude and general demeanor isn't any where close to socially normal in terms of sin'dorei society as a result. Cauric struggles to understand simple social concepts, and can be quite slow at picking up things that'd be obvious to a majority. It doesn't exactly help this elf seems to have a decidedly defined term of 'JUSTICE' he genuinely follows to an obsessive degree. Using this appointed set of beliefs to sometimes attempt forcing his opinionated sense of decency on various Horde members. Of course with the predictable results that this distinctive mannerism is generally not appreciated at all - especially when their business is interrupted by his apparent nosiness and paranoia.\n\nOne of his most defining traits is a stubborn desire to never surrender on these 'righteous' ideals. Outright refusing to back down from any mental, emotional, social or physical challenge on these views when provoked. Depending on the current situation; it is Cauric upsetting any opposing viewpoints that makes daring attempts to point out flaws in his mindset with markedly shallow insults. This response, naturally, has nearly ended his life many times since he rather foolishly engages in such activities around remorseless criminals dwelling with Murder Row. Regardless, it has yet to completely dampen his spirit.",

Currently working as a mercenary healer, she can be easily persuaded for the right price, just don't expect her to be out on the front lines.\n\n{h1:c}Background{/h1}\nSent out at a young age by an uncaring and forgotten family, she was forced into a secular caravan alone to channel the power of the Light. Unmotivated and having no real idea why she was there, Resina struggled to make any connections with the other students and masters. As she grew, her knowledge of the Light did as well, albeit at a much slower pace than her peers. Just before becoming an adult, she decided her lessons done, long having seen the Light as just another source of power rather than anything truly divine. Shortly afterward she ventured out once for the first time of her own will, to the last place she remembered before being sent to the cleric caravan. She didn't know what she was going to do or even say, but she was sure they would get a piece of her mind. \n\nWhat she found was barren sands and dunes, all along the way. Once she had finally reached the last place she could recall, there was nothing for her. Initially distraught, any feelings she had towards them quickly faded to nothing. And so she went off again, having no direction and little world view of anything outside the desert.\n \nAfter a long struggle through the dunes, she finally found a glimmer of hope: a roaming band of mercenaries going about their business and covered in old wounds. Soon enough, a mutual need was satisfied. The mercenaries needed someone to keep them alive, and Resina needed something to do with her life, a true purpose. That and the funds to live properly on her own, which she was provided in troves. It all fell apart just weeks later when the group was reduced to blood in the sand and swords in the ground. Fleeing, she learned a valuable lesson: nothing good ever lasts.\n\nThis lifestyle continued for quite a while, banding with groups of fighters to keep them safe for extravagant fees while putting on a smile and conveniently leaving out what happened to the last ones. She always resented how cute and bubbly the cleric girls acted when she was little, but learned that it was good for business, so it would have to do. She's not all that good at it anyway, but it never hurts to try.\n\n\n\n\n\n{col:ffffff}The part in the additional information was originally a joke, but you can decide to take it as canon or not. She won't bring it up either way.{/col}",

Her body is slender with a vaguely athletic build, though she has an adequate bust and generous rear. Her tail is bushy and fluffy. Kyleeh's claws can leave a scratch or two but clearly she's not much of a fighter. And while not immediately apparent to most races, Kyleeh is considerably taller than the average vulpera, just don't call her dire. She's around the average height of female dark iron dwarves, if a bit smaller.\n\nKyleeh generally doesn't wear much beyond her underwear. But during times when it's more appropriate or her self esteem falls too far, she will put on a dress of some sort. She likes to have earrings and a necklace but often misplaces her jewellery. She seems especially fond of her seashell jewellery and has actively taken care to not lose it for any reason. More recently, she has also acquired a beautiful necklace of immaculate craftsmanship from the mysterious chatelaine Emira.\n\nKyleeh has developed a fondness for cosmetics, particularly fond of purples and blacks. Her dark violet lipstick pairs well with her black eyeliner and sparkly purple eyeshadow. Her nails are painted a dark purple as well, matching the colour of her favourite bra.\n\nKyleeh's staff is of naga origin, as are the bracers she wears at almost all times.

						["TX"] = "Shy, somewhat of a scaredy-fox, lacking self esteeem, cute, these are the words that perfectly encapsulate who Kyleeh is as a shaman and as a vulpera. She is a rain shaman who onced used healing waters to mend wounds and bring life to the empty desert. Her capacity for empathy and emotional sensitivity make her susceptible to great pain, but also the capacity for great love as well.\n\nKyleeh enjoys teasing and telling jokes. She feels a sense of belonging when her desire for attention leads to increasingly outlandish behaviour. She can't handle her alcohol, often resulting in embarrassment. As something of a hopeless romantic, Kyleeh endlessly fixated on her ideal romance. Her greatest desire in life is to find her soul mate and experience true love and happiness. These obsessive and clingy tendencies have resulted in a series of failed relationships that had serious and long lasting effects on Kyleeh's life.\n\nBut for Kyleeh, it was not the end. She would not give up. Too many new friends cared about her and she wasn't simply going to fade away forever. Though her future is still uncertain and troubled, Kyleeh still believed. For the first time in a very long time, Kyleeh had the chance to simply live in the moment. With a sense of routine and a loving environment to relax and enjoy life, Kyleeh assumed her troubles would simply go away. Her problems were not solved so easily. Resentment built up, gradually destroying her confidence and leaving her full of guilt over events that had never actually happened. Her relationships crumbled quickly as most were built on a foundation of haste and fear. She even, in her desperation, married someone she lusted for but never truly loved. This marriage ended in the death of her wife, an event that seemed to almost leave no impact on Kyleeh.\n\nKyleeh left Pandaria feeling oddly certain and calm about her future. Kyleeh returned to Orgrimmar calmer and more clear headed than she had been since she became a shaman in Vol'dun. She would stay with her dear friend Borrev for a time, relying on his charity and kindness. She was crying most every night and struggling to just get through the day sometimes. The defeated vulpera wasted away in Orgrimmar, no longer believing love could find her. She embraced her depression as absolute truth and hoped death would claim her soon. But this failure, as with her previous ones, faded with encouragement and kindness. Kyleeh relied on her friends and perservered. And her patience and mental strength were rewarded richly with good friendship and great experiences. Kyleeh began to learn sign language to speak to her deaf friend Uhka.\n\nKyleeh found herself in a series of memorable and passionate encounters with the mysterious vixen Emira, though she had stronger feelings for her close friend Taanai. Kyleeh would attempt to romance Emira knowing Taanai was already in a relationship, but between her conflicted feelings and awed admiration for Emira's elegance she found herself unable to continue further with Emira. Instead, Kyleeh decided to finally voice her feelings for Taanai. The path to love was difficult but Kyleeh and Taanai felt the same and made difficult choices in order to make their relationship work. Despite a rough start, Kyleeh and Taanai's relationship quickly became a strong bond. Taanai's patient attentions and constant encouragement to stay involved socially with their friends ensured Kyleeh never truly felt alone.",

						["TX"] = "You can see Bekrash in all his glory. He's massive, even for an orc! Large streaks of bodypaint cover his rippling muscles. The paint is made of a mixture of ash, clay, oil, and water. His skin is smooth, hairless, shiny and healthy looking. Seems like he bathes frequently. It's dark reddish brown, the color of fired clay. Warm looking. His fire red hair is long, and arranged into a thick mane consisting of a great multitude of braids.\n\nHe has the broad features of an orc. His hairline is set high on his round forehead, with eyebrows that seem to be permanently bunched and arched as though upset by something. His eyes are bright and clear, with a pale yellow iris. They flash with a peculiar, bright red light when he feels strong emotions.\n\nA prominent nasolabial fold marks the area between his cheeks and mouth. His nose is squat, seeming slightly flattened. His upper lip is very thin, while large, sharp tusks protrude from his lower jaw, which is covered by a thickened lower lip. His tusks are black colored now, with a peculiar looking texture. They have a faintly purple colored sheen, when the light catches them.\n\nHe has huge, broad shoulders, and large pectorals that he pops whenever he wants to show off. A large, diagonal scar runs across his chest, starting above and past his right nipple, and slashes downward, extending beneath and past his left nipple. His arms are thick all around, heavy with muscle, but he's surprisingly agile with them. Large veins bulge from his huge biceps, which are decorated with tattoos. His hands are very large, with more prominent veining. His fingers are thick like a sausage. He looks like he could easily crush a mans skull just by closing a hand around it, or punch through solid stone.\n\nBeneath his wide chest, he has a huge fuck-off six pack that blends into a pillar like waist.  Shredded serratus muscles bulge from his ribs and large obliques push through his skin on either side of his stomach.\n\nHis hips are narrow, and his muscles form prominent diagonal lines at either side of  his groin. Veins can be seen faintly bulging through the skin, at the very lowest part of his flat, rock hard stomach.\n\nBekrash's backside is firm, and well rounded. It flexes with each step. His thighs are massive, and together with his rock hard calves he looks like he could choke a horse.\n\nA complex network of dark tattoos can be seen branching and wrapping around his hips and buttocks, reaching up to his lower back, and extend down to his thighs and calves.\n\nIt is always too hot for Bekrash. He used to run around naked all the time, but when he came to Orgrimmar, the grunts told him he couldn't enter unless he covered himself up. He wears the bare minimum required to enter the city. Bekrash is almost entirely naked but for the loincloth that barely preserves his modesty. He still undresses if he's traveling outside of a city. Sometimes, he'll encounter people on the road, and they get upset with him, or ask him why he's undressed, out of concern or curiousity.  His answer is always the same, \"The elements protect me, I will not reject their gift.\"\n\n* * * Whisper me to view the NSFW section, 18+ only * * *",

						["TX"] = " Bekrash loves to cook! His favorite food is something he calls \"meatbread\". It's just a small, hollowed out bun stuffed with spiced meat and cheese. He eats them by the platefull.\n\nBekrash has a big heart and loves pretty much everyone. He's kind of rough looking in the face, but he's nice to people unless they give him a reason to not be.\n\nHe likes all the races of the Horde, but all Forsaken, Deathknights, some Demon Hunters, and Shadow Priests make him uncomfortable, Still, he tries not to be rude to them. About the only kinds of people he doesn't care for are Warlocks. Demons are dangerous and the people that mix with them are stupid or crazy. Or both.\n\nHis connection to the elements has rendered him something of a hedonist. He knows he shouldn't overdo things, but somtimes he'll indulge a bit too much. When he first came to Azeroth, he heard an elven bard sing about \"Wine, women, and song\". Well, that about sums it up, doesn't it? Life for mortals is full of struggle and pain. Bekrash believes that the highest good therefore, is to live a life that avoids inflicting suffering others, and to do whatever can bring the greatest pleasure.\n\nBekrash can enoy almost anything, whether it is cooking, eating, drinking, singing, arguing, fighting, loving, or partying. The elements have shown him that life is beautiful and he has a seemingly unending joy for life.\n\nHe uses magic, but in the strictest sense, he does not cast spells in the way a mage does. He directs elemental spirits, and these spirits produce tangible effects in the world such as projecting a fireball or making food appear out of thin air. He has a number of 'utility' spells, simple acts of magic that have practical uses like cleaning things or creating water. He uses when he cooks. He also uses these sorts of utility spells to store and retrieve personal items that he does not appear to be carrying.\n\nBekrash's speech is peppered with idioscyncratic references to what he calls the \"Song of the Elements.\", a sort of non-corporeal \"music\" that he claims to hear.\n\nHe can on occasion be seen unfurling a large scroll and writing in it.",

					["HI"] = {
						["TX"] = "Bekrash was born with the gift of magic, but as a child it seemed locked up inside him somehow. He is a member of the Bleeding Hollow clan of Orcs and spent his earliest years living with his family in Tanaan Jungle. As a boy, his Chieftain told him he would not die on Draenor, and that his destiny would lead him to foreign stars. Shortly after that, Bekrash ran away, and wandered for many years. Sometimes he'd get into trouble, but he always found a way out. He ended up in Nagrand. In his years of wandering, he heard stories about the Elemental Plateau. They intrigued him. Something pulled him there.\n\nAs he neared the Plateau, he began to hear the voices of the elements on the wind. The very ground itself seemed rise up and meet his feet and pull on him. It was telling him where to step, how fast to move. The wind pushed him on.\n\nHe made it to the Throne of the Elements during a tremendous thunderstorm, and the air buzzed with energy. Bekrash's heart was pounding in his ears, his breath came in furious, ragged gasps, all his muscles were tensed tighter than a saberon crouched for a kill. He heard a name on the wind, spoken by a voice louder, clearer than all the others. Something swelled in Bekrash's chest, and his voice exploded out of his throat. With a terrific flash of lightning and a great crash of thunder, Bekrash screamed the name \"INCINERATUS!\"\n\n In an instant, all fell silent, the earth opened up, and in a great gout of flame, something emerged. It was gigantic, and great waves of heat radiated from it. Bekrash was pushed to the ground from the violent, hot winds that blew all around him now. The thing before him was a Fury of Draenor, a powerful elemental spirit. Something like a head rested atop its great body, and turned its gaze downward to Bekrash. It made a noise, but it wasn't speech, it was, all at once, the explosion of an eruption, the chaos of a firestorm, and the gentle crackle of a campfire. It was Bekrash's anger, rage, fear, hate, but also love, passion, pride, and ambition. It spoke, and Bekrash understood. In his heart, Bekrash felt the magic inside him come loose. Spirits were with him on Draenor, and he would find more in the land of his destiny, a place under foreign stars. The Fury directed him back to the land of his birth, the sweltering jungles of Tanaan.\n\nOn his journey home, Bekrash realized something in him had changed. He felt hot all the time, but wasn't sweating. He ripped his clothes off and abandoned them. He was not ashamed of his nakedness. It was... freeing, to wander the wilds of Draenor in this manner. It made him feel more connected to the elements. He could feel the wind dancing across his skin, and the sun shone on his face, arms, back and chest.\n\nBekrash's encounter with the Fury on the Throne of Elements had left him with a powerful feeling. Something flowed through him, and it made him feel... Not stronger, but safer.\n\nHis first act of magic was in Talador. He encountered a Lightbound Draenei, who was upset by Bekrash's nudity. The Lightbound tried proselytizing to Bekrash, and Bekrash tried telling the Draenei that he only needed the power of the Elements. Bekrash turned away from the Draenei, and the Draenei followed. The Draenei grew annoyed, and grabbed Bekrash's shoulder, to turn him around. Bekrash spun around, and moved to punch the Draenei. Instead, a flash of fire shot out of his hand, and seared the Draenei's eyes shut. The Draenei screamed and writhed on the ground. Bekrash had never hurt a person before. He'd killed animals, for food, and he'd killed goren, which weren't really \"people\" people. He even killed a botani once, and that was a plant.\n\nThe flesh on the Draenei's face had melted over his eyes. What he had done frightened Bekrash. His breath caught in his throat. There were other Draenei in Talador. Should he find help? Would they help? Would they be angry? They would be angry. Orcs and Draenei kept getting into conflicts. This wasn't good. Bekrash weakly said \"Someone will find you\" and fled. He became angry with himself. How did he do that? Where had the fire come from? He was aware he was still a child.\n\nHe returned to his people in Tanaan, and his reception was... less than welcoming, initially. When he approached the spiny pallisades of his village, the guards thought he was mad. Demonic influences still worked in the dark places of Draenor after the fall of the Iron Horde, and Bekrash's people thought he might have had his mind addled by a demon. It had been many years since he had been to the village of his birth, and the people did not initially recognize him. The village shaman met Bekrash outside, and Bekrash told him about his years of wandering. About his encounter on the Throne of the Elements. He showed the shaman how he could make fire come out of his hands. He told him about the perpetual feeling of heat in his body.\n\nAs near the shaman could tell, Bekrash was born with a connection to the elemental plane of fire, and the encounter on the Elemental Plateau with the Flame Fury had opened something inside Bekrash so that he could now channel the power of the Furies from the plane of fire. The perpetual feeling of warmth he had was just a side effect. Bekrash was allowed back into the village. It's not like anybody had never seen a naked orc in a place as hot and humid as Tanaan. The Bleeding Hollow recognized Bekrash as a man now, and a full member of the clan.\n\n A few years later, the entire Bleeding Hollow clan  left Tanaan Jungle for the safety of Hellsreach Citadel, in Gorgrond. Encounters with the Lightbound had grown far more violent. The Orcish clans of Draenor new they needed to band together.\n\nThe clans of Draenor unified because the Lightbound were now forcibly converting Orcs and even some Ogres, and killing anyone that refused to turn over to the Light. One day, the entire Lightbound army marched on Hellsreach Citadel, and offered a final ultimatum to the Mag'har. Give themselves to the Light, or die. Chaos ensued. Death surrounded Bekrash. The cultural differences between the Draenei and Orcs sometimes resulted in friction, but after the fall of the Iron Horde, both peoples seemed closer. They had found common ground in fighting an enemy that threatened both races. Something changed afterwards. The Light came to the Draenei, and had bound itself to them. The Light brought with it suffering and death.\n\nEmissaries of the Horde of Azeroth appeared, and offered assistance to the Mag'har. They wanted to bring the Mag'har to Azeroth. A small group of warriors stayed behind to fight the Lightbound. The emissaries from Azeroth worked strange magic, and light filled Bekrash's eyes. He could feel his connection to Draenor's Furies become tenuous, fading...\n\nThe sounds of fighting and death faded and was overcome with something like thunder. A sudden, violent jolt shook Bekrash, and he opened his eyes. He didn't recognize where he was. The land was hot, dry, and dusty. He was surrounded by other Mag'har, but his parents were nowhere to be seen. The massive spiked walls of a great city lay before him. He was in Durotar, in front of the great gates of Orgrimmar. That night, as he wandered the streets, dressed only in a loincloth, he looked upwards to a sky filled with nebulae and constellations. He looked and understood. He had fulfilled his destiny. He was in the land under foreign stars.\n\nBekrash took time adjusting to life in Orgrimmar. He was upset that his parents were left behind on Draenor. He took some small comfort in the fact that they most likely died in battle fighting the Lightbound. He couldn't conceive of them worshipping anything like the Light when it had brought pain to so many. He found more comfort in the bottom of a mug of ale and the arms of the many exotic women of the Horde. To them, he was exotic, something new, this painted orc in a loincloth.\n\nIn Azeroth, Bekrash could no longer feel the comfort of Draenor's Furies, though the heat was still in him. His experience had left him weakened. He could only make a small, weak fireball. Whatever effect his encounter on the Throne of the Elements had, it seemed that it was permanent, regardless of distances of time and space.\n\nBekrash sought out a shaman, for counsel. It was not difficult locating one, many of the races that made up the Horde had strong shamanic traditions. What was difficult was finding a shaman knowledgable in both the Azerothian Elements and Draenic Furies. Bekrash found him, an old, blind Troll so thoroughly riddled with arthritis he could barely move. He was something called a witchdoctor. Coming to Azeroth so suddenly had thrown Bekrash's \"mojo\" out of balance. Bekrash's connection to the Furies of Draenor was strained, like injuring a muscle unaccustomed to work. Bekrash needed medicine. The old blind doctor mixed odd ingredients into a cauldron of fuming liquid. The ingredients were odd things with intangible qualities. An old leather belt, said to be the bonds of family. Bekrash lost his family on Draenor and would need to find his own place on Azeroth. The second ingredient was the scream of a gryphon. The elements of Azeroth could not hear Bekrash yet, and needed something to carry it on the wind. The third ingredient was something the witchdoctor called \"Latent Heat\". It was a thick, gummy light blue liquid in a bottle. The witchdoctor had to cut it with scissors as he poured it into the cauldron. The cauldron bubbled and fumed furiously. The witchdoctor bid Bekrash come near, and breath deeply.\n\nThe effect was immediate. The room spun about Bekrash, and the witchdoctor laughed as he fixed his milky eyes on the orc. Heat welled up inside Bekrash. He was falling. He was falling into infinity. Winds carried him through the clouds. A cloud shaped like a man held him in its massive hand and wrapped him in its fingers. Bekrash fell, through sea and sky and fire, deep into the heart of the earth. He was in a desert. He could feel power underneath him. Some vibrated beneath his feet. Every grain of sand felt like it was alive. The queen of the earth bored through his skull with amethyst eyes. He felt very small. Bekrash tumbled into the abyss, and was swallowed by a whale. Water flowed over him, under him, and through him. Bekrash was in the ocean and knew he carried the ocean inside him.\n\nThere was fire in the sky. Stars fell. Moons exploded. The universe was aflame with life. It burned in Bekrash's soul. With far, distant eyes, Bekrash could see Draenor. The Lightbound. His parents. The Furies of Draenor looked at him. They stood alongside the Elements of Azeroth. He saw the space between infinities. Order and Chaos. He saw and understood. The universe whirled around him. Solar fire and terrestrial flame licked his skin. Every nerve was stimulated. Pleasure and pain blinded him.

					["TX"] = "{h2:c}{col:ff000c}APPEARANCE{/col}{/h2}\nA warrior through and through. Falanthos carries himself with pride, dignity, and perhaps more than enough resoluteness. Standing at a height most impressive for his kind, it comes as no surprise that Falanthos quite literally looks down upon others of his race. As if his towering height wasn't enough, Falanthos also carries around quite a bit of bulk. Broad shoulders, tree trunk arms, a torso which seemed to be sculpted from stone, and powerful legs to keep him supported. His skin had darkened somewhat over his life, though he was still a few shades away from a sun-kissed look. His flesh, while not particularly soft thanks to his way of life, was warm to the touch, with several old scars of varying sizes dotting his body. \n\nHis hair, the color of ink, was usually left to its own devices. Most often the knight allowed it to grow out so that the back of his neck was hidden behind his locks, while a few lucky strands laid out down his chest. When the length becomes a hassle, Falanthos keeps it all tied into a tail, looking quite wild. The ladies like it, so he manages.\n\nAs an elf of the highest birthing, Falanthos possesses the traits born to all children of the high home. Long and thin brows, pointed ears, and the characteristic glowing eyes. His shine a golden hue, thanks to the blessing of The Sunwell, and his own mastery of holy magics. Most notable about his eyes, or rather his left eye was the scar that ruined the perfect symmetry that was his face. Starting a few centimeters above his brow, the scar seemed to have been made by a blade, given how straight the line is. It trails all the way down his face, stopping a few inches before reaching his jaw. A pointed nose rests above his lips, usually found in soft scowl or a neutral poker face. A sharp jaw rounds his face together, and as of late, he's allowed his facial hair to grow out some, it helps him appear more mature he thinks.\n\nWhile the knight hasn't decided yet whether or not to get a tattoo, the option is still there. The only piece of jewelry on his person happens to be a locket in the shape of a star. Inside is a picture of an elven woman, most likely someone special to him. \n\n{h2:c}{col:ff8500}EQUIPMENT{/col}{/h2}\n\nAs a blood knight, Falanthos has specialized in fighting in close quarters with heavy armor and a variety of weapons. Plate armor consists of most of his attire when out in the public eye, and always accompanies him when on a campaign. While he can choose from any number of weapons to take the the field of battle, his most common choice is a light-blessed steel greatsword gifted to him by the Order of Blood Knights. This blade means a great deal to the elf, as it was this weapon of mass destruction that laid waste to thousands of blood-thirsty demons, nightmare spawn, undead monstrosities, and more than a few Alliance warriors looking for vengeance for the fallen king Varian.\n\nA list of less heroic but still equally important equipment includes:\n\nA short blade, mainly used for parrying or in circumstances where a greatsword isn't ideal.\n\nA set of goblin goggles, used primarily for scouting long distances or seeing in the dark.\n\nAn ornate dagger used in rare occurrences, or to surprise the enemy.\n\nAs for armor, Falanthos has a bit of a bad habit of being unable to decide which to use. A wide range of different sets of armor with different themes and styles are his greatest collection. Some draw inspiration from orcish heavy plate, others are issued to him by his order, and others are some he simply had commissioned for the pure aesthetic.\n\n{h2:c}{col:5b5b5b}ABILITIES{/col}{/h2}\n\n\nFalanthos far outclasses the common soldier in a number of ways, ranging from fighting techniques, mastery of certain weapons, an assortment of versatile spells and a deep understanding of magic. \n\nAs a veteran of several campaigns across Azeroth and taking part in numerous battles, Falanthos has sharpened his skills as a warrior, as well as picking up on some of the lessons taught by the indigenous peoples of some of the lands he's been to.  \n\nFirst and foremost, Falanthos is most effective going toe-to-toe with his enemies, most often with a two-handed weapon in his hands. While swords are prefered, axes, maces, polearms, staves and other large weapons are all just as deadly in his hands. Finding a shield on the elf would be a rarity, though when the fight calls for a more defensive approach he does not shy away. Falanthos also can find success while wielding two one-handed weapons, or with blade in one hand and magic in the other. Firearms and other ranged weaponry are almost never witnessed, though in the knight's hands, he can still do his job. The only weapons out of his arsenal are fist weapons. They are useless.\n\nHeavy armor protects him from certain attacks, if not completely negating the damage from a poor strike or a weak swing. In addition, the rare metal known as Lumenstone plays quite a roll, as traces of the stuff can be found imbued into his armor. This, while not wholly protecting him from magic, does allow him to not be totally helpless when against spell-casters. Mobility-wise, the elf isn't well off enough to be a major danger to enemies at a distance, even with the natural agility his kind is commonly known for. \n\nThe Light may be the knight's most powerful weapon, however. The ability to both mend his own wounds and that of his allies while also dealing righteous destruction upon his enemies should not be underestimated. Those who call him 'friend' can rely on an assortment of healing spells. Cuts, broken bones, burns, poisons, and certain illnesses are nothing the knight cannot handle. More grievous wounds may take longer to heal, but are still doable. Life-threatening wounds or severe neglect are perhaps the only thing Falanthos cannot mend. \n\nOn the opposite side of the battlefield, the knight is truly a force to be reckoned with. A bold fighter, he cares little for wounds he may sustain while in the thick of a fight, allowing him to fight with a more aggressive style. Of course. The Light can also be used to reduce most of his foes to ash. His specific choice of harnessing the Light's Wrath involves channeling the power into a form of fire. Just as lethal as natural fire, this form is most effective when used against demons, undead or evil beings in general.\n\nDuring his time in The Broken Isles, Falanthos trained with the Valarjar Vrykul. One ability the knight picked up on was runic magic. His most prefered spell is on which increases his strength to rival that of an ogre for a short time. This runic spell requires a great amount of stamina to preform, and is used only in dire circumstances.\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffea00}HISTORY{/col}{/h2}\n\n Born into a middle class family, Falanthos was the youngest of three children, coming after his brother Saris, with both brothers coming after their sister, Beledra. His father, Anastarin worked as a construction worker, while his mother Velsia worked as a priestess. Growing up as the youngest of the three, Falanthos was forced to endure an endless barrage of sibling-bullying, especially from his brother. This in turn sparked a sibling rivalry which lasted all the way well into adulthood. Upon reaching a mature age, Falanthos stuck around with his family, mainly finding work with his father's employers. The young blood elf behaved in a typical fashion for one of his age and standing. He worked hard, and played harder. In keeping up with tradition, Falanthos and his brother often competed over a number of trivial things, such as displays of strength, drinking contests, and perhaps the most competitive-- women. This was the only life Falanthos knew for quite some time. Of course, the possibility of a run in with an Amani was always there, but most occurrences ended without incident. This life was about to change though with the onset of The Second War.\n\nThe fall of Stormwind weighed very little on Falanthos' mind at the time, though his concern grew as the armies of The Horde drew closer and closer to Quel'Thalas. When the Amani threw there lot in with the orcs, Falanthos knew just how foolish he was to ignore the rising threat of the crazed orc hordes. Their advance was made all the more daunting with the arrival of enslaved red dragons. As such, Falanthos only got to experience a handful of skirmishes with the orcs and trolls before the threat of winged beasts pushed he and his allies behind the walls of Silvermoon. It was here that the boy began to change into the man. Fortunately for the high elves,\n\nAfter The Second War, Falanthos remained in Quel'Thalas, having little desire to travel so far away from home for the sake of bloodshed. Life changed for him and his family, especially the relationship with his brother once the fighting had stopped. Saris believed it was necessary to cross The Dark Portal and take the fight to the orc's homeland, while Falanthos thought it would merely be a waste of men and women. Shaken by the things the both of them had seen, the had a bit of a falling out. Playful rivalries slowly evolved into open arguments, with the brother's eventually coming to blows over almost everything. The one thing the pair agreed upon was the Amani issue, with both of them doing all they could to protect their home. \n\nWhen the plague of undeath sprouted up within Lordaeron's borders, Falanthos prayed for them, but knew there was little he could do. After hearing of Arthas' purge of Stratholme however, the elf worried deeply for the stability of his human neighbors. This concern was made into a full blown crisis after the death of the human king, and Arthas' fall into madness. With the shadow of death creeping closer and closer to the borders of Quel'Thalas, Falanthos prepared for the worst. What came was more terrible and harrowing than anything he could have imagined.\n\nAgainst this new enemy, Falanthos and his people stood little chance at victory. With their army shattered and chaos seeding into the land, he and his family had no other choice but to flee their home. It would be the last time he would call Suncrown Village home ever again. Witnessing the slaughter of his friends and destruction of his home was one thing, but the corruption of The Sunwell was another thing entirely. He and all other high elves felt the ramifications of this loss almost immediately. Their sacred fount of holy and arcane energy had become corrupted. The High Elves, and eventually all of Quel'Thalas would fall victim unless something was done. Unfortunately, the only option that would cease the flow of corruption was the destruction of the very thing which gave the High Elves life. Under the leadership of prince Kael'thas, the survivors renamed themselves the Blood Elves in honor of those who fell.\n\nOnce the main undead army marched back south, the rebuilding began. The first trial was overcoming the reality of the numbers of those who had fallen. The vast majority of Falanthos extended family had perished, and most of his friends fell in battle or lost themselves to their own sorrow. His immediate family was spared, though they would not remain intact for long. Beledra left Quel'Thalas at the earliest convenience to find her own path, while Saris followed Kael'thas to the orcish homeworld, now known as Outland. With both siblings gone and his family losing everything, the situation seemed hopeless. The cravings for magic was soon to follow, bringing a whole list of other problems for the Sin'dorei to endure. Madness and crippling weakness took hold of those who couldn't survive, while the loss of power in general pushed the elves into an even more vulnerable position.\n\nExistence was a struggle for the few that remained, and even with most of the undead leaving their lands, they were still a dire threat. With their armies shattered, it fell to the few soldiers remaining to defend the land still left untainted by Arthas' march. In addition, the amani reignited hostilities once the blood elves were left exposed. There simply wasn't enough manpower to stop the incursions. Then, Falanthos' salvation came in the form of a deity of light. Kael'thas, the last prince of the blood elves managed to transport the creature known as M'uru to Silvermoon, in hopes that his people may harness the near-boundless power within the holy being. Falanthos and his people were skeptical at first, seeing as how the light did little to aid them in their plight against the undead. Many didn't see the point, that was until the creation of the first Blood Knight.\n\nLady Liadrin showed that even if The Light had abandoned them, they could still harness its power. While Falanthos never personally felt connected to The Light, the ability to call upon it was a momentous boon to their current situation. The Light was especially effective against the undead that remained in Quel'Thalas, as well possessing ways to combat a range of other foes. He joined the newly created order of Blood Knights at his earliest convenience. His life changed forever once he was invited into the fold, his acceptance made a rather clear choice thanks to his physical prowess and dedication to seeing the undead destroyed. Accepting the power stolen from M'uru was a euphoric and terrifyingly awe-inspiring experience. Power unlike anything Falanthos had held before was now at the tip of his fingers. It would take time for him to harness this newfound strength, but he knew once he mastered it, none would threaten the high home again and survive.\n\nWith the addition of the Blood Knights on the battlefield, the situation within Quel'thalas began to stabilize. Much of Eversong was recovered, but across the Elrendar river was another story. The 'Ghostlands' were still crawling with undead and amani trolls, with nearly all of the settlements brought to ruin. The task of reclaiming the land was daunting, with many seeing it as near impossible. That was before the blood elves received a helping hand in a most unlikely ally. The Forsaken claimed to be free from the Lich King's will, and seeked the bring the blood elves into the fold of The Horde. The idea seemed preposterous at first, until The Forsaken revealed they were led by Sylvanas Windrunner. \n\n\nIn the following weeks, more and more territory fell back into the hands of the blood elves, though the corruption from Arthas' assault made the land relatively useless. Still, Quel'thalas would not abide scourge minions within her borders. After many trials, the combined forces of the Blood Elves and Forsaken were prepared to launch an assault on the Scourge base in Quel'thalas, Deatholme. The traitor Dar'Khan Drathir, who was largely at fault for allowing Arthas entry into Quel'thalas met his end, with his head removed from his rotting corpse for all children of Quel'thalas to see. With their homeland secured and Dar'Khan brought to justice, the blood elves were welcomed into the ranks of The Horde, a decision many still see as controversial.Many would rather see Quel'thalas thrive on their own, while others saw the benefit of a new alliance, seeing as how the humans were no longer an option. All that remained now was to find their wayward prince, Kael'thas. Which meant their next destination was the shattered homeworld of the orcs. Outland.\n\nThe rest will have to be discovered through IC interaction.\n\n{h2:c}{col:0eff00}PERSONALITY{/col}{/h2}\nA lone wolf to the core, Falanthos has valued his solitude for as long as he can remember, opening himself to only a select few lucky individuals who are blessed enough to be within his good graces. That being said, the knight has a very short temper and is prone to violence, a disability clinging to his psyche ever since he stole M'uru's power. This in turn, makes it hard to make friends. Go figure.\n\nOff-duty, the elf tends to keep to himself, often found against a wall or some solid object. A keen eye keeps track of those around him, sizing up his fellow horde brothers and sisters. Rarely does the knight approach for conversation, though he does not shy away should he be dragged into one. Not afraid to speak his mind, Falanthos is rather blunt, as well as mixing in a healthy bit of sarcasm when the situation calls for it.\n\nHis relationship with The Light is strong, granted his path in life. Since the Sunwell's rebirth, it's become more intimate. Contrary to what most shadow-loving cretins might say, Falanthos does not have a blind faith in The Light. He follows his own creed and trusts his own judgement when faced with a dilemma. He is his own man, and does not need a divine force to live his life; he holds The Light in high regard. It does not control him.\n\nWhen slighted, Falanthos does not back away from challenge. Those who dare dishonor him or those he cares for are on his shit-list for all time. He never forgives, and he never forgets. \n\n{h2:c}{col:ffffff}POLITICAL AFFILIATION{/col}{/h2}\nPerhaps a surprise to no one, Falanthos holds his homeland and people above all others. While loyal to The Horde and all its tenets, this particular Sin'dorei will always act on behalf of Quel'thalas first before anything else.\n\nPrideful, but not pompous.\n\n{h2:c}{col:ff00fa}OTHER SHIT{/col}{/h2}\nRP guilds are cool.\nAll themes accepted, save for ERP. Sexual tension and themes are still fine.\nWhisper if you'd like me involved in your stories. \nIf you RP a loud and annoying mentally stunted waste of skin, I'm probably going to ignore you.

(joke)\nIf your rogue/thief/shadow assassin character has ever 'faded into the shadows' I want nothing to do with you.\n\n\"Blood Knight bad!\"-- NPC #132\n\nWhisper me for anything else you'd like to know :^)\n",

Together We Prevail.\nForward Unto Dawn{/h1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c}Physical Description \n{/h1}\n{p:c}Helfar was quite the physical specimen thanks to rigorous training dedication and especially disiplin. To start, his torso was well built, His shoulders are broad with a well defined pair of pecks further down. Below those he would have a well defined abdomen, Helfar sported an 8 pack,though none of this would usually be seen due to his armor. However if he was wearing a shirt his muscles would be seen through it easily. As for his legs he kept them well trained as well, having good quads and hamstrings and calves, his rear was also fairly toned. In addition, Helfar’s face was chiseled, with golden eyes that glowed with the light. Atop his head his hair is blonde and cut short. Though he had been known to allow it to grow out at times, it all depends on what he feels like at the time. As for what helfaar would typically wear, he usually would be in his plate armor, more specifically his blood knight armor, colored in reds, blacks and silvers. One could sense it was enchanted and blessed by the light if they were sensitive to such things. As for weapons, Helfar was most proficient with greatswords, short swords, shields and polearms. Through that does not mean he can’t use other weapons to varying degrees of skill. Host often however Helfar carried a greatsword of Ravendreathen make, or a sword and shield of rather intricate design. The greatsword, glowed with light and some Vynthir magic, the blade is strong enough to stand up to blades several times its size and width and is nearly indestructible. And finally, around his neck usually hidden beneath his armor, he would wear a silver necklace, on this necklace there would be 4 military dog tags and a blue crystal of sorts. On each of the tags there would be some wording. One would read “Helfar Fardawn #0258,” the second would read “Honor in service” the third tag would read “Ma’krish #0259” and the forth would simply read “In memoriam”. Helfar would wear this necklace even when without his armor more often than not, it holds great importance to him.\n{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality\n{/h1}\n\n{p:c}Helfar is a largely pleasant man,he was raised well by his parents and is usually pretty polite, respecting most that he speaks to unless wronged by them, even then he is not against forgiving people and when he can he throws a bit of wit and humor into conversation, he usually has nothing against a good joke. However Helfar is a devoted light worshiper, he believes that the light should be used to help people, heal those in need and dispense justice against evil. Often does he humbly ask for the light's grace and protection he has worshiped since he was a child and carries great respect for those who respect the light and the balance between light and void. \n{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}History TLDR/How you might know him\n{/h1}\n{p:c}Helfar’s first campaign took place in Outland. He fought in Zangarmarsh, Netherstorm Shadowmoon then was later recalled to aid the shattered sun on Quel’danas.\n\nHe fought in Dragonblight and Icecrown during the Northrend campaign Loseing a close friend in the process. He went into retirement after the conflict was over and stayed that way until the Pandaria campaign.\n\n\nReturned to service during the Pandaria campaign, at first fighting in the dread wastes and later joining the frey in the isle of thunder. Here he gained the rank of knight master and the title “The bloodedge.” He renounced the title by the campaigns end.\n\nDuring the siege of Orgrimmar he was severely wounded by an orc blademaster and was subsequently dragged back to the healers by Nadra who was watching over him at the time.\n\nDuring the Draenor campaign he fought in talador against the shadow council and Iron horde respectively. He later went on to fight the Fel horde in Tanaan jungle. \n\nWhen the legion conflict begain Helfar’s ship crashed in Azuna and he wandered wilderness alone for a month until reconnecting with horde forces in Suramar. He assisted in the liberation and later offensive on the broken shore. He also was pleased to be working with the silver hand again.\n\nUpon the beginning of the 4th war he was stationed in the Arathi highlands. For his skill in defensive warfare he was promoted to Knight lord. He went on to fight in Nazjatar and later against the black empire in Pandaria and Uldum.\n\n\nSomeone may know helfar form any of these campaigns, from being a blood knight, from his time as a priest or him possibly enhancing something for you.\n\n\n\n{/p}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-EversongWoods:512:256}\n\n{h2:c}History - early life\n{/h2}\n\n{p:c}Helfar was born 132 years ago to a noble mother and father, his father was a high ranking mage and his mother a priest. For the first 5 years of his life his family lived in Quel’thlas before deciding to move to human lands in the southern eastern kingdoms. Their reason for this was that his mother and father were both enchanters, and such skills were very profitable and in demand in the human kingdoms. Thus they ventured south and helfar along with his two sisters were raised in human territory. Those lands were not entirely devoid of other high elves through and helfar befriended what of his kin he could along with some humans. As he grew up he was taught the ways of the light and enchanting by his parents, helfar took to the light quickly by the time he was 18 he was almost prepared to become a full priest. However, helfar had always leaned primarily holy magic and little void. In the final years of his training he looked over many tomes on the subject and practiced what he could, for a time all was well until he reached beyond his bounds. One day Helfar wished to attempt a powerful void spell, apparently it would create a torrent of void energy at a point of the wielder's choosing. This was out of his league, and when he attempted it the void exploded as he channeled it knocking him several feet away and leaving a void rift open where he once stood. The rift consumed life killing the grass and sucking in other various objects as the rift became larger. Helfar thought that would be his end, until an instructor sensed what was happening and sealed the rift, but at a price. It left one of the man’s arms withered and useless, from that day on Helfar swore off void magic. He would never use it again, but from that day whenever he encountered that darkness it would always whisper the words. “DOST THOU DESIRE THE POWER'' even though he never did.\n\n{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-GenBeauregardsLastStand:512:256}\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c}History-the beginning\n{/h1}\n\n{p:c}Helfar went on to specialize in holy magic after that day, he was forgiven by the priest that saved his life. But for a time the guilt of the event did remain with helfar. So in action he strived to make up for it. As a priest he helped those in need however he could. He healed the sick, gave advice to those that needed it, delivered sermons at times and even vanquished some restless spirits on a few occasions. His life continued peacefully like this for decades, along with his work as a priest he worked in an enchanting business with his family. They had become quite wealthy by this pont life was good, until the first war. At the time of the fall of stormwind during the first war, Helfar along with his immediate family lived there, as such they were forced to evacuate boarding ships to Lordaeron. When his family was settled in and a discussion was had, Helfar's parents decided that they would go out and fight in the 2nd war. Helfar, not being the type for battle at the time, remained in Lordaeron for the duration of the 2nd war healing the wounded while his parents fought far from him. Years later,by the wars end his parents did return as veterans of the 2nd life eventually, went back to normal things for the Fardawns were peaceful. They returned to stormwind eventually, evading the devastation of the third war when it came, though word of it had not escaped them and it weighed heavy on their hearts for years. In all this time however, something with helfar’s father had...changed. The man was going mad, sometimes ranting and raving about nonsensical things, developing a at times rather angry personality and refused to speak to other non elves for long periods. His father’s health weighed heavily on Helfar’s mind time and time again he was berated by his father due to the madness, and the thought of his homeland often made him wish to do something. He had all of this power in the light, he always had he needed to do something. This all came to a head one day when helfar decided to train as a paladin, as such he joined the silver hand for a time after a couple years of training he left. Not long after did he inform his mother that he would journey to Quel'thalas he wanted to help the Sin’dorei after what had befallen them. Helfar asked his mother to journey with him but she declined; she wished to stay and care for his father. Somewhat saddened by this Helfar said his goodbyes to his mother  and promised they would meet again. Unbeknownst to Helfar however, his mother was not going to leave him alone, she sent a Quel’dorei battlemage by the name of Nadra Doria after Helfar to keep an eye on him and protect him over the years. Nadra remained ever vigilant, sometimes even taking on illusions or disguises to talk to Helfar while he was none the wiser. \n\n{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-bc-HellfirePeninsula:512:256}\n\n{h1:c}The Burning Crusade\n{/h1}\n\n{p:c}After a month and a half of traveling Helfar had finally reached the gates to Quel'thalas. There he found guards two stationed which upon seeing him demanded him to halt and explain the reason for his coming, they had seen the blue in his eyes clear as day. Helfar then said to them “Long have I been separated from my homeland, I have come to rejoin my people.” The guards were intrigued one produced a Fel crystal from his robes and told Helfar to drain the crystal dry. Somewhat hesitant he did, his body felt like it was burning as he absorbed the corruptive magic but he endured, his eyes now tainted green. After that he was let through and made his way to the hall of blood, quickly enlisting a Blood knight. There he met someone he did not expect to find a priestess he had known in the past by the name of “Ma’krish” she had enlisted as well. The two caught up over time and became friends, helfar however excelled at his blood knight training alright being trained by the Silver Hand some time prior. Ma’krish on the other hand was midway through her training and the two became full knights at around the same time and were assigned to the same division, not long after they were sent to netherstorm to battle against the forces of Kael'thas and after that to shadowmoon valley. Battle took adjusting to for helfar, but he took to it all the same,he found no pleasure in killing especially if it was any of his even brethren he had to say. But things like demons he took no issue with, he had always seen them as foul and unholy,worthy of only being sent back to the nether. Helfar and Ma’’krish fought together every step of the way, becoming the best of friends. He couldn't ask for a better companion but one final obstacle remained, the sunwell. By the conflicts end the sunwell was restored and Helfar eventually bathed in its light as most blood knights do. He could have given up his faith that day but he did not, the Light was always a part of him and so was believing in it. \n\n{/p}\n{h1:c}The Northrend campaign \n{/h1}\n \n{img:Interface\\Credits\\CreditsScreenKeyArt2WotLK:512:256}\n\n\n\n\n{p:c}Helfar eventually returned home to Quel’thlas to rest after his time in Outland was done. But this was not to last. The lich king awakened from his sumber on the frozen throne and threatened azeroth once more, as such the horde and helfar with it journeyed to Northrend to combat the scourge. Most of his time in the Northrend was spent in dragonblight and Icecrown, as always he fought with his good friend Ma’krish. The two had grown quite close at this point, Helfar though he never stated it had begun to have feelings for her but duty came before such a thing. He hoped to make his feeling clear to her when the conflict ended, little did he know she had the same idea, but this was never to be. The contingent of knights Helfar and Ma’krish were assigned to marched from Agmar’s hammer to the horde stronghold at the wrathgate.They were to be reinforcements for the struggling horde forces but they came into contact with a medium sized scourge force and a skirmish erupted. The battle lasted about an hour before it concluded. The blood knights were victorious, Helfar even killed his first Death knight. A feat he was proud of but it was short lived, during the skirmish Ma’kish had been slain. Her blood seemingly entirely drained and her corpse withered. Helfar was nothing short of devastated once her death sank in. He was given her dog tags to remember her by but for the remainder of the conflict there was an air of sorrow about him. He had to press on, he knew that is what she’d want and he went on to survive the remainder of the war in icecrown. By the end Helfar had had enough, he decided to retire and take up enchanting for a living. Throughout the cataclysm he maintained this profession, living quietly and contemplating his past. \n\n\n{/p}\n{h1:c}Pandaria\n\n{/h1}\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-Pandaria:256:256}\n\n\n\n\n\n{p:c}Years later the conflict in Pandaria had begun Helfar, still being a civilian at this point felt somewhat torn about the conflict. At first it just seemed as though it was another war for territory, but as news continued to flow in as the days went on Helfar learned that there was a supposed “Darkness” in pandaria. This eventually prompted him to rejoin the Blood knights, they were happy to take him back as an old veteran. A day after rejoining he was sent with a new unit to the dread wastes. There he battled the mantid and quickly did he discover that they were under a sort of void influence known as “The sha” \n{/p}\n\n{h1:c}Bloodedge\n{/h1}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\LFGFRAME\\LFGIcon-ThunderForgotten:256:256}\n\n{p:c}Helfar performed exceptionally in his return to service. He fought with renewed strength and determination, but something happened to change Helfar in the midst of his service. One day, Helfar was taking leave and on his way home when he came upon seral portals with other Sin’dorei rushing out of them. Quickly he looked the scene over and spoke to a nearby guard who explained to him the slaughter in Dalaran. At first he was shocked, but this feeling was soon replaced with anger and a desire for vengeance. To himself he said “I will deal out justice for this atrocity and by the light it will be so!” Helfar immediately forgot his desire to take leave and went to volunteer to venture to the isle of thunder. There he became known for his ruthlessness and his tendency not to take pensioners be it Alliance, Zandalari or Mogu. For this ruthlessness he was promoted to the rank of Knight master and was granted the title “The Bloodedge.” Due to this Helfar was well known at the time, but after the brief truce when the gates of the thunder kings palace were opened he began to question if he should be acting this way. By the end of the campaign on the isle he decided to renounce the title his reason was cited to be”I do not wish to be known for blind zealotry and slaughter” \n{/p}\n",

Seeing the cruelty displayed by both sides he began realising that fighting face to face was a pointless waste of time and effort.

Ceracus \"Cera\" Dearing upholds every ounce of the tenets befitting knights down to its most common principles; though, not without scrutiny. Considered an outcast amongst his kin and their connections, the knight walked with a bitter determination and commodity of conscience. Values and morality never the same thing; at least, to him.\n\nA stature of height isn't the only thing to command respect, but the posture in which it's fostered, and Cera marries bulk and brawn with the statuesque demeanour to keep it carved in marble. Taught in yesteryear to tame the natural inhibitions to scale back, a dog-eared determination refuses to rouse any laxness upon his pale person, and maintains that mantra despite how stern, cold, and unfathomable the aura he exudes. Exhales that seek exodus concentrate through pursed tiers, eyes train with a cautionary circumspect, and a right-hand claims its crown upon his beloved sword's pommel. Every digit upon the left-hand, apart from the index and thumb, remains cleaved to the knuckle in a harsh reminder of a rigorous past; because of such, his expert swordsmanship hails solely from his right-hand. Confidence without arrogance, and arrogance without its consequences. \n\nA broad face, chiseled in bulk, remains scarless except for a tiny scar just under his left-eye, some small swipe of a dirk. A thick brush of prickly hair, oft kempt, trims without tear to his jut of jaw, high cheekbones, and marries at the hidden cleft of clutched chin. The severe ridge of his browbeaten narrow forbodes fiery thought, a volcanic heat with a molten portcullis that refuses to show its flame. The neutral lines to venerable features come across as unsettling for their fortitude that lacks change; as if truly sculpted. {/col}\n \n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-ArtifactTEMP:256:128}\n\n{h2:c}{icon:spell_priest_divinestar_shadow:25}{col:bbbbbb}• • • • • {/col}{icon:spell_priest_divinestar_holy:25}{/h2}\n\n{h3:c}{col:bbbbbb}Hooks, hubris, and general information!{/col}{/h3}\n\n{col:bbbbbb}• Many Sin'dorei and Quel'dorei would know of Cera's exploits, both good and bad but always grand in scale; a leader in the efforts to eradicate the remaining Scourge from the shattered Quel'Danas.\n\n• An expert swordsman; a mix of brutality and sly agility cultivated his renowned antics and loyalties.

						["TX"] = "  Eskender was born as the second and last child of Hirom and Ruuta, and younger brother of Okoth in the Alterac Valley after the Frostwolf Clan had been exiled by Gul'dan once they had crossed the Dark Portal into Azeroth. During his youth, he was very close with his father, whom was a wise and noble shaman. Hirom had begun to help train the ways of shamanism to his eldest son, Okoth and had been guiding him. Eskender tends to carry much of his fathers wisdom and strength with him to this day to honor his memory. His mother, Ruuta looked after the two brothers and loved and cared for them greatly. She too saw great promise in Okoth and supported him as well with his elemental powers and spiritual connection.\n\n* During the conflict between the Frostwolves and the Stormpikes, Eskender's father was slain by Okoth, who had deserted his shamanistic ways and became a warlock prior to the incident. Eskender grieved and sought out vengence, but he remembered the lessons his father taught him and chose to let it all go and move on. Soon after, his mother fell in a deep state of sorrow and never moved past the lost of her mate. Eskender did everything in his power to help her move past their loss but unfortunately, she passed on over to her ancestors. Eskender made an oath to himself that he would never seek to punish his brother for his treacherous actions that broke his family apart. Since then, the elders of his clan had taken good care of him and were proud when he had came of age.  \n\n* He soon joined his chieftain, Warchief Thrall to free his imprisoned orcish brethren in the internment camps. He also journeyed across the sea to Kalimdor where he fought beside his chieftain and brethren in search of a new land for their people, though his heart will always remain in the Alterac Mountains. He eventually enlisted in the newly formed Horde and fought in the Third War against the Burning Legion. He was present at the Battle for Mount Hyjal and fought alongside the Humans and Night Elves, an event that has stayed with him to this very day. \n\n* Over the many years, Eskender took part in many of Azeroths historical conflicts, he lended his aid to the Argent Crusade against the Lich King, chose to rebel against his former Warchief, Garrosh Hellscream, and ventured to an alternate version of his homeworld, Draenor. Numerous times his brother would threaten him for not joining him in his demonic ways, and each time, Eskender would boldly refuse. Over the years, Eskender would witness and often times even participate in some of the Hordes atrocities throughout Azeroth. He would even begin to question his own loyalty to the Horde. He despised the way that the Horde had started to become and even had thoughts about abandoning it entirely. \n\n* Eskender was also present at the Burning of Teldrassil. He truly believed that he had lost his honor for participating in the burning and slaughter of a people he had called an ally long ago. He would even despise himself for that very reason. During the Fourth War, Eskender had come across a noble human paladin while out scouting in Nazmir. The two soldiers immediately clashed, but showed great honor and respect towards each other as enemies. Their battle caught the attention of a few blood trolls and were both ambushed by them. The paladin was knocked unconscious and fell in a marshy river. Eskender fought off the attackers and was even wounded in the process. Once the ambushers had been dispatched, he chose not to finish the human off, but instead showed compassion when he rescued him from the water. \n\n* During a battle, Eskender was captured and taken to Stormwind for interrogation where he was beaten and tortured by the guards everyday. One of the two guards had recognized Eskender from the War of Thorns and had taken personal vengence of tormenting him the worst. The other guard had extreme hatred in his heart and would rather see Eskender dead then and there but still enjoyed witnessing his torture. They had contacted his brother, where it was revealed that they too, delved with demonic magic and had informed him of his little brothers location and predicament. \n\nSeeing his chance, Okoth met the three of them on the outskirts of Stormwind and gave Eskender a choice, \"Submit to him or Die.\" Eskender believed that he could save his brother from his demonic ways by reminding him of his old shamanistic life. The trio laughed at him and decided that he was as good as dead. They planned to behead him but decided to torment him some more before they could. Eskender was mere inches away from losing his life until a blast of holy light errupted near them and had saved him. It was the paladin that he had encountered back in Nazmir. He had promised Eskender that he would help him regain his honor in return for sparing his life during their fight.The human secretly looked after him while he was in captivity and even pleaded for him to be released, but none would listen. \n\nWhen the paladin arrived, he was shocked and angered by the amount of treachery that he was witnessing. He immediately battled the two guards and did his best to protect Eskender from them. The paladin had even managed to blind one of them before they could both escape. Okoth had stabbed Eskender directly in his heart making sure that he wouldn't leave there alive. The human attempted to end Okoth but was stopped by Eskender who insisted for him to be spared. The human used his powers to heal away the wounds throughout his companions body and was greatly relieved to see Eskender back on his feet.\n\n* After that, the two were both present at the Mok'gora between High Overlord Saurfang and Warchief Sylvannas. They eventually became good friends and even consider  each other as family despite their obvious differences. Eskender answered the call to battle once more when the sky shattered. He has been helping out in any way that he can with the conflict and hopes for a greater future for Azeroth.\n\n",

Another quality of him was his ears, making him considerably taller to most standards.  Curved slightly at the top and would bob while he walked due to their size.  It was large ears or his piercing eyes.  That were red, quite the deep red as if the dying embers of a fire.  Though one thing one could not forget was his nose.  Carrot shaped.  He would commonly rub it or something to hide it, perhaps due to some hate for the whole thing.\n\nHis garb would carry around some rather astute pieces to perhaps show his nature as a businessman.

Both of his forearms and lower legs have been replaced with robotic prosthetics. Even his hooves are now hefty blocks of bronze-plated solid steel.\n\n• Those who are familiar with the different schools of engineering on Azeroth would recognize his mechanical limbs to be, strangely enough, Mechagonian in design. They are expertly crafted, and are near constantly thrumming with energy.\n\n• Said energy seems to be sourced from the almost fluorescent red markings on his body; the barely noticeable glow coming from beneath his skin growing brighter, then darker in time with the lights on his prosthetics.\n\n• The last bit of visible robotics on Solrukh is his right eye, the orb and socket replaced entirely with metal and a glowing crimson piece of optic tech. Surprisingly, it doesn't do anything fancy besides enabling him to still be able to see from the right side. At least, as far as he knows.\n\n• The reason behind all the mechanical bits on the tauren becomes clear when one looks where machine and flesh meet; the tissue there is heavily scarred, remnants of burns and other nasty looking wounds remaining still on Solrukh's thick hide. Whatever catastrophe happened to him, must have been enough to take his extremeties along with it.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h2:c}{link*https://www.heroforge.com/load_config%3D22050163/*Rough Visual Reference}{/h2}\n\n{h2:c}{col:FF1D00}Personality{/col}{/h2}\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-BurntEarth:512:5}\n\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}• Solruhk is certainly the loner type. Happy to take part in as little conversation as possible, he tries his best to keep to himself. However, he does like eavesdropping on others, hence why he even bothers to appear in populated places.\n\n• If one does manage to get him talking, they'd find that Solruhk is a pretty stereotypical Bloodtotem, personality-wise. He finds it hard to trust others, particularly non-tauren, and his violent nature often extends to his words.\n\n• Despite his anti-social nature, Solruhk is capable of caring for others. Those that have managed to befriend the Bloodtotem are few and far between, but those small few have earned themselves a stalwart companion.{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\prestige-icon-6-4:128:128}\n\n",

So basically, this player is still rather inexperienced in WoW RP, most other experience being from very casual RP be it in a game or anywhere else. He is also NOT a native english speaker, thus sometimes a slow reader and typer but hopefully not too slow, and his vocabulary might not be always rich. Sometimes I literally have a translator open to fully comprehend what's being said, woops....{/p}\n\n{h1:c}Story{/h1}\n{p:c}Like most death knights, Garnacuga doesn‘t remember anything from his life before his ressurection. All he remembers is waking up in the middle of the night into fear, anxiety, confusion and choking while feeling a strange frosty aura radiating around his body. He felt very cold, stiff and was tearing up. He didn't remember who or where he was and what happened. Before him stood a wolf-like humanoid figure with blue light illuminating from her eyes. It appeared to be the death knight who brought him back. She sighed and didn't look happy. She figured the ressurection was a rare case and the vulpera retained all his emotions and was then too confused and vulnerable to wield the powers of a death knight responsibly. Without a word she knocked him out and locked him up in a hideout where this newly raised vulpera death knight spent an unknown time learning about his new powers and what it meant for him now that he became a death knight himself. The next thing he remembers is waking up, again, in the middle of the night in Vol'dun near the caravan hideaway. As he opened his eyes he saw the frightened faces of his vulpera friends who seemed like they are not sure whether to be happy their friend is back or to weep because of what has become of him..\n{/p}\n{p:c}His people were rather cautious around him and did not seem to trust him much anymore. That's why he decided to leave his home to serve the horde and make his people proud by his deeds. Despite serving the Ebon Blade and the Horde, his people are still the most important to him and tries to show he is still one of them. Or maybe it is just that he tries to convince himself he is.{/p}\n{p:c}Garnacuga’s past has many unknowns. Since the day he was risen, he has found out some things with the help of others, yet there are still many that he wishes to figure out.{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}Physical Info{/h1}\n{p:c}Physically, Garnacuga had to be a very well-built Vulpera in life. His body is quite muscular and athletic, even in his current condition, making him stronger than the majority of living vulperans. His body is very durable and sturdy to the elements and physical attacks, which might be partially both a perk of being a Death Knight and a remnant of his training before his death.\n{/p}\n{p:c}He has a white and dark grey fur. His fur is quite messy and wild yet it shows some signs of attempts of proper grooming. Due to not wearing much armor, his whole body is covered in many battle scars of different sizes. His grin reveals that he's missing a few fangs. He has no signs of decay, apart from losing some fur recently.{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}Personality{/h1}\n{p:c}Garnacuga's mental side is a complicated one. On one hand, he can get super cocky about his physical traits and is convinced he is very attractive even for being basically dead. He never hesitates to show off his muscles and scars, which are exposed most of the time.{/p}\n{p:c}Otherwise, he is a wreck. Insecure about his death knight powers and convinced everyone he would meet would initially hate him for what he is. Unlike most of his comrades, he hasn't lost emotions and can feel anything, positive or negative, just like a living individual.{/p}\n{p:c}Most significantly, this makes him suffer when he kills or makes someone else suffer, sooner or later feeling remorse and having to hide these feelings as it would render him weak and useless. Every kill sates his neverending death knightish hunger but depending on who or what he kills, it hurts him on the inside too.{/p}\n{p:c}In combat, he is ruthless and has little care for what could happen to him, taking great risks while attacking furiously and moving swiftly thanks to the lack of armor, which labeled him as a berserker.{/p}\n{p:c}Off-duty he tries to be as normal as possible, trying to fit in with the living, though he might often appear as a shy lone fox. He likes to make meaningful relationships and always makes sure his friends know they have his support and protection.{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}Weaponry{/h1}\n{p:c}Garnacuga is barely ever seen with any other weapon than his two one-handed blades. Seemingly, he has always been specialized in dual-wielding and feels vulnerable whenever he doesn’t have a weapon in each hand. His blades are tied to his bracers with chains to make sure he never loses them during a battle.{/p}\n\n\n\n\n",

The location was never revealed to anyone outside of Morrigan’s personal circle of trusted allies. There was a massive library and a fully stocked laboratory that were both used frequently. Today’s venture though, was something on a more personal note.\n\nMore screams sounded, echoing from the room at the end of the hallway, which led to the laboratory. \n\n“Did I not warn you? I’m fairly certain I made it very clear that if I were to catch you harassing my dear friends again, we were going to have words.” Morrigan’s voice in another setting may have come off as darkly alluring, but to the male Sin’dorei tied to the table, it was anything but. It was a siren’s song, and he knew it.\n\n“This is far more than just words!” He said, exasperated and trying with the last bit of his energy to pull free of his restraints. He was sitting in a large chair made of obsidian, magical shackles bound to his wrists, ankles, and neck. Every time he made to struggle, he collapsed back into the seat, panting. The warlock never once touched him. Not yet. She simply stood in front of him, her hands folded in front of her as her half smirk grew. \n“What’s wrong? The struggling not helping?” She cooed in a grotesquely sweet tone. He responded only with a glare, which only enticed a soft giggle from her lips.\n\nMorrigan moved closer to him, her hips swaying hypnotically as she approached, her hair brushing just past her shoulders, just barely kissing to top of her chest.\n\n“You see… lovely,” she began, pausing in front of him to look over her prey. “These chains are not just bound to your flesh alone, no no…” She giggled, walking over, and running her index finger gently over his arm and up to his shoulder as she passed. “Those are bound to your soul. Every time you struggle, you’re only pulling at your own soul.”\n\n“Bitch!” He snapped his head to the side, trying to keep her in his vision, but she had slipped into the shadows. \n\n“Oh, baby doll, I’ve been called far worse than that,” she let her melodic giggle fill the room again, now coming back into view, but something was clutched in her fingertips. He could not quite make out what it was since he was too focused on the devious grin on her face.\n\n“It’s rare if I don’t allow someone to correct their mistakes. I gave you a chance to not come after one of my people again and you ignored my warning. See, when that happens, then we have a problem.” Her grin faded into a stone-cold expression as her purple hues locked with the male’s fel green gaze. “You became a problem.” \nBefore he could retort, his mouth beginning to open, Morrigan’s hand shot forth, her fingers gripping a purple shard, pointed at him. Instead of words, his face contorted to a ghostly length as he wailed in agony. Wisps of his soul seeped out of his pores as if an ethereal sweat were being pulled from them. The ghostly wisps became caught in the purple swirling vortex that was the attraction of the shard. \n\nHer lips moved as she softly chanted an incantation, her free hand helping gently guide the male’s soul into the shard. \n\n“You spent so much time fighting yourself, you weakened your own soul for me,” she stated as the last of the Sin’dorei’s essence was absorbed into the crystal. It pulsed, a now silent protest from the broken man. \n\nMorrigan’s full dark purple lips returned to a predatory smile as she looked down at the shard in her hand. “Thank you,” she said, sliding the shard onto her necklace with the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Well, for the Vulpera, the sun has always been the skyborn provider ruling the dunes above and beyond any mortal. Simultaneously gentle and unapologetically brutal in its unbiased judgement, many fox people of Vol'dun saw it as something worthy of their reverence. Their prayers for its protection and, occasionally, strength in the destruction of their enemies, even to shine its light on riches meant to satisfy good fortune. Not so much a diety in theological terms, it nevertheless held a power over the sands beyond the Vulpera's simplistic comprehension. Thus was it a guardian spirit in some ways.\n\nSome Vulpera took to these beliefs and faith far more aptly than others, and it was these who the Light blessed. Naturally the Vulpera knew nothing of the Light, and therefore was it translated as the sun's blessing; paragons upon which the Sun bestowed its powers. Priests and Priestesses of the Sun, such as Sueko, eventually became increasingly commonplace before the destruction of the 4th War.\n\nHer time outside Vol'dun has awakened her to the realization that hers are not the only people who revere the Sun! Often does she hear of the Sunwalkers and Seers of the Tauren, or the priests and paladins of the elves, and that curious head of hers strives to learn more about these beliefs that seem to run parallel with her own!\n\n(( It's all headcanon.

A square jaw ever set in a manner that seems to convey irritation and a likewise chunky, somewhat blocky chin complete the package. A small mouth sports thick lips that are curled into a perpetual sneer thanks to a set of Orcish tusks that protrude from within the confines of her mouth. \n\nDark flesh spans the woman's form from ear tips to toes, an olive undertone giving her a slightly off-color complexion when placed next to some of her Elven kin. Brown-red hair looks to have been hacked away by an unsteady hand, cropped short and  generally unkempt. Those messy locks usually smell of a curious blend of herbs that one might have trouble sorting out.\n\nShort but pointy ears have been pierced numerous times from the cartilage down to the lobes, everything from simple dark iron hoops and tragus piercings to industrial bars composed of the same material. \n\nHer left eye is amber, sporting a dull glow that varies wildly from one month to the next. The right is milky, devoid of the Elven glow, and likewise turned in toward her nose, should one study her long enough to notice! That lone good eye is often narrowed with scorn, as if she views those around her as more of a nuisance than anything.\n\nA sturdy neck slightly larger than her handspan across leads down into a thick collarbone and broad shoulders. Her torso is longer than is considered acceptable, where most elves boast long legs, this section makes up the most of her height. Larger than average ribs support an ample, high-set bosom. While her stomach should be flat, a layer of muscle beneath the dark, olive hued flesh causes it to bulge outward slightly. Washboard abs, tilt included! Her sides curve inward subtly beneath the ribs and flare again at a set of broad hips. \n\nA plethora of scars can be found all along her torso, ranging from the claws and fangs of animals to the projectiles and blades favored by humanoid foes. This woman has clearly not lead an easy, quiet life...and she wouldn't have it any other way!\n\nLengthy arms that are thick with muscle and overyling fat boast a myriad of scars: Determining where one long-healed wound begins and the next ends could easily be turned into an obscene party game of sorts. Her hands are thicker than those of most Elves, long dexterous fingers covered in callouses while her palms remain somewhat smooth. Any familiar with the wear and tear caused by a  bow could easily guess that such is her weapon of choice. Nails meanwhile are kept filed down to a simple squared shape, left unpainted.\n\nLong legs begin with thick, well toned thighs which lead into calves of the same type, the lower half of a long distance runner and climber. The woman's rump is well rounded and quite firm, as it's mostly muscle. While her feet are usually hidden, they possess the same heavy callousing as her hands. Her toes sport squared nail tips as well, though likewise with the above, they remain unpainted. \n\nA series of commingling Orcish and Troll tribal tattoos stretch along the flesh of her back, twining serpents and scorpids laced with phrases in Orcish text: \"Death before dishonor\" can be seen clearly between her shoulders, while \"Live for Glory, Strength, and Fury\" can be found woven through the backs of serpents along her spine from mid-back down. \n\n{/col}{/p}\n\n{h2:c}{icon:inv_inscriptionlanathelquill:25}OOC Notes:{/h2}\n\n{p:c}{col:7D7D7D}Sen is half Laughing Skull Orc, being the spawn of a Main Universe Skull, she is not the wannabe stand-up comedian type. \n\nShe's not -that- kind of crazy, though she is a stark reminder of precisely why the MU Skulls were distrusted: The woman is cruel, violent, sneaky, treacherous, and not above thievery and dispatching her foes in less than honorable ways. \n\nThe Elf-Orc is capable of kindness, but generally only when it serves her.\n\nWhy yes, I'm using growth pots. They put Sen at roughly the same height as female Orcs, where she ought to be! \n\nPlayer is chronically ill and takes long breaks from RP. Almost always still happy to chat or help with content, but the creative bug takes a dive when feeling under the weather. <3\n{/col}{/p}\n\n\n",

She shifts between being an extreme socialite in the presence of her twin, Kalistra, or when she can manage the energy to be social. At other times she has a chilling and aloof glare, observing the area around her with steepled fingers and shadowy schemes in her misanthropic mind. When seen in person with her twin, she is most definitely the relaxed 'blue' to her twin's spastic 'red.' \n\nShe is often seen sitting idle, inspecting one of the cards or runes that float about her in nonsensical, lazy circles. She bares the blank stare and eerie presence of one who has looked far too long through the veils of time and space, lost in temporal points and continuums.\n\nProne to fits of mania and bouts of distraction after long periods of sulking, she can come off as highly abrasive to most others. Some consider this her form of affection, others her lacking in social finesse to form meaningful relationships with anyone but her twin. Often her motives for doing self-destructive actions seem to elude her own logic, reasoning, or desire to evaluate her own psyche.\n\nSomething of an addict in her own way, and most visibly when not in the presence of what she considers her disturbed older twin she scours and devours all sources across of Azeroth and beyond for new and exciting magic and knowledge. Divination seems to be for her beyond a mere obsession and drive, but a literal addiction to collect and study until the font of arcane and illusive knowledge of the past, present and future is completely dried from experience.\n\nDespite her childish demeanour, obsession with fashion and the political powers in Silvermoon City, socialite gawking and general lack of boundaries towards other sentient beings, an off-handed remark or two denoted the hidden depths of a calculated, masked intellect within the depths of her eyes - if one was keen enough to catch it.\n\n((Still a giant work in progress.))",

Normally she wares her hair in elaborate designs that look like it took hours to prepare, but on days where she adventures, it is usually kept straight and flat. The features of her face are soft. Like most elves, her nose, and chin are angled and straight but still match the softness of her composure. Her lips, small, but covered in a wine red lipstick. From her nose, hangs a elaborate silver nose-chain. The chain travels from her left nostril and runs all the way to her left ear. On her right ear where several rings, all of gold and silver. The left ear however, sat only two rings, most likely due to the scar that takes up most of the ear.\n\nHer shoulders where, slender, and usually perched atop one them was her wasp familiar. On each shoulder where two runic tattoos that seem to hum and glow with arcane life. The tattoos continued all the way down her arms. Changing in pattern from arcane runes, to floral patterns and designs, they ended at coils that wrapped around her fingers. Matching her frame, her chest was tight, although smaller than most other elves, she uses her clothing to accentuate her subtle curves.

Knee-high boots protected her feet, they too looking to be made of the same dark, decorative leather as the teddy.

All credit goes to Rob Sacchetto\n{link*http://zombieportraits.com/author/rob-sacchetto/*Artist Website}\n{link*https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3082337*Patreon}\n\nA phantom, a specter roaming the world as a shade of a person who exists in those that loved her to be little more than a tragic and remorseful memory. Bitterly roaming the land as a damned soul, a marauder of death, detached from the natural order that governs life. Searching for a place in this new, unforgiving life, she wanders from place to place in what appears to be a vain, fleeting hope. Accumulating power, making acquaintances, and running from the ghost of her past; Lady Hex finds herself in what can only be described as a bleak, endless wasteland masquerading as a vibrant, song filled forest.\n\nWith mummified flesh of a pale white color whose icy touch sent shivers through the spine, there is no mistaking what she is: Dead. A life long lost. With an echoing voice and hateful teal eyes the nature of Sabilla is revealed to be that of a Death Knight. oozing a horrifically foul unholy aura to match the putrid stench of rot violating the air around her person, this forlorn specter's mere presence is an appalling onslaught on one's senses. With sharp features making up her face the high cheek bones are not complemented by the sunken cheeks possessed by this elf, pulling and hugging the bones of her face. What had been lush lips now dried and cracked, uncared for by this banshee, much as the silver white locks of hair drained of color sat withered and coarse.\n\nBelow her ghoulish facial traits lay a cadaver still cold as the powers forcing it to move. Sabilla may have been a looker in life, but death does take its toll, even on an elf. Still, though, the death knight remained fit with clear signs of lean muscle on her body should she even bother to find anything other than her armor. That plated saronite, a quarter the weight of steel and impossibly durable, served her well and kept this woman alive. Preferring attire complimenting a curvaceous frame, she is as agile as strong. Along with an ease in killing her prey, she is still the killing machine the Scourge created her to be. Fortunately for us all, the instinct to slaughter on sight is not quite as profound as she was during the days of being a blight on the Plaguelands, instead favoring the company of mortals and finding herself quite the social creature despite the pains.\n\n{h2:c}OOC Details:{/h2}\n>Sabilla is not anti-social or moody! If you want to walk up, she's very open to it. If you want -her- to walk up, just let me know and she will!\n>This character is neutral in terms of faction. So Alliance characters are welcome to interact with her. Also Exotics are -adored-, so don't worry.\n>\"Realism\" is not a big priority for myself. I'd rather you express your creativity in ways you want. Be it story, aesthetics, or otherwise. Just have fun.\n>Non-canon rp's are fine! Personal plotlines are lovely. Short term and long term rp's are accepted.\n>No preference on post size. If you're more comfortable with one lining, go for it! Want to post big? Go nuts! I'm not a mirror poster, I'll post what I feel comfortable posting regardless of post size. Usually this will be 2-5 WoW paragraphs in most scenes. This can go upwards to 20+ paragraphs or as little as 1 line depending on the rp.\n>I like newbie rpers as much as I like veteran rpers.\n>Level is not something I'm concerned about in rp.\n>Dark or \"Mature\" elements can be involved in rp. Macabre, death, cannibalism, rotting corpses, torture, necromancy, other taboo subjects are likely to be involved in rp. (Also, yes, that kind of rp too.) Let me know what you're comfortable with and what you're not.\n>Willing to rp in Party Chat, Whispers, and do world rp.\n>Whisper me any questions! I'm fairly open minded.\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Ghostlands:512:256}\n",

They were bright blue, just like the ocean, and gazed around with a rather calculative stare. He was often well chiselled and most definitely spent a large portion of his time either training or being out in the wild. A dragonslayer like himself would be naturally fit and muscular, but this Orc was a straight bulwark. He was way over six foot tall, with a fierce mohawk and a mangled body, scars on almost every part noticeable. He was a rather handsome fellow, despite his scars and incosistencies, and it was clear that he didn't care for the scars and cuts he had all over his body. He came to grips with his lifestyle and was more than happy to continue doing it every single day, despite what it does to his body.\n\nHis hair was Platinum in color, and he had an ungroomed ruggedly beard upon his chin, proving he was a little over thirty just by the bags under his eyes and the mature tone of voice of which he spoke. \n\n\nOne words that people used most to describe this beast of an Orc was 'tank'. He was tall, muscular, ravishing and deadly. He would never let one of his enemies survive a fight, and this included humans, Dwarves, Night elves and more specifically 'dragons'. This Orc hated dragons with a passion, it was a pet peeve, a hatred. He slayed dragons with one eye, for it was only his left blue eye that was visible. The curse that Fel gifted this Orc with came with a gently glowing eye, and with it, a deep scar. His right eye was always closed, or when it was open it was just an empty socket, so he opted to eitehr wear an eyepatch from time to time, or just keep his eyes closed so he could fixiate the focus onto his working eye.\n\nThis Orc walked around with two huge axes that rested on his back by a tight leather strap. They were dripping, oozing with the blood of his enemies almost all the time, and was made of some of the strongest steel ever to exist on Azeroth. He carried them with ease, and used them to harm and slay any dragon that came in his way. His armour was dark in color, burned from tip to toe from all the time he spent hunting whelplings in the Burning Steppes. It was scarred from place to place, dented all over and even had holes in it in some areas. It appeared this man simply just did not care.{/col}",

He was quite brutal in all honesty, and didn't have many cares for anything other than bloodshed in this world. His gaze often flowed around the people around him with only negative intent, and he was merciless in the way that he travelled aorund the city. He was never displaying any sort of welcoming demeanour, and it was clear from first glance that he was not a Orc that wanted to be stopped and talked to within the streets.\n\nDespite his merciless and brutal attitude, he wasn't the type of Orc to straight up beat anybody that approached him, especially if they were women. A well gifted Orc like Vansing  was sure to be a good magnet for beautiful women that wanted a good time, however he never cared for it. He was just a weoful individual with nothing but his next mission on his mind. He cared only for making money, killing dragons, mortals  and breathing.

He was a handsome young chap with nothing on his mind, however this was soon to be changed. He used to venture through Hillsbrad, down to the Wetlands, through Dun Morogh and into the Burning Steppes. His end goal was to reach Stranglethorn Vale and explore lands unknown, however his venture were cut short when he bumped into a merry band of killers at the northern path of the Burning Steppes. These travellers were on a desperate mission to hunt down and kill a black dragon that had rumoured to be in the south of the Burning Steppes, and Vansing desperately needed money, so the desperacies collided and he joined the adventurers.\n\nHe went with them to the South of the Burning Steppes and had nothing but an axe and a rifle to accompany him, however it seems that this was all he really needed. When the group got to the south of the steppes, it appeared there was a very dark cave, beaten into the side of a mountain. It required some climbing to get to, however the bunch eventually arrived. From inside there was nothing but the sound of heavy breathing and groaning from the rumoured dragon within, and this stirred the men to turn away. They had finally arrived face to face with a sleeping black dragon and now they realised the risk it came with. Did they really want to die, eaten by a dragon for the sake of wealth?\n\nEach and every traveller turned around to walk away, except for Vansing. He walked into the cave with a lit torch, made of a magma block attached to a steel rod. He woke the dragon with a loud scream and then pointed the rifle point black towards it's skull. With the pull of a trigger, a bullet flew through the dragon's head and damaged it's scales, and Vansing rushed forward with an unsheathed axe, ramming his axe down into the Dragons' neck. The now wounded dragon ensured the other travellers were confident enough to return and help Vansing, and that is exactly what they did.\n\nThey all stormed back in, one by one. Thaniel a High Elf mage casted a crippiling frost spells into the Dragon's legs. Din'jo a Troll berserker swiped his poleram into the Black Dragon's arm, chopping one of them clean off after striking a weak spot multiple times. Finx an Undead rogue tossed a whole cannister of poison into the Dragon's eyes and blinded it, causing the dragon to wail out in pain. With one final blow, Vansing raised his axe, now stood atop the dragon, and brung it down onto an unarmoured part of the dragons' skull, causing it's brain to get lodged with the blade. The dragon slowly wailed and fell to death. Each of the ''brave'' men took a tooth from the dragon as a souvenier, but Vansing took nothing. He found a passion in the acts he just committed, so he needn't take a souvenier when he knew for sure he'd be back to kill another when the time came.\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\Arch-Race-VrykulBIG:256:512}\nDue to the pleasure he received from killing this dragon, and after killing so many more throughout the next few years, Vansing actually formed a band of travellers that were primarily focused on hunting down and killing dragons, and that is what they did for five years to come. He recruited about twenty four people, excluding himself, and over the five years they travelled all over the world to hunt down these dragons that they killed. Some of them were child dragons, some baby dragons, some adult dragons. They were all dangerous and they were all out to kill these adventurers, however only fifteen succeeded. Over the five years, nine men and women were lost due to the dragons and their might, and each of them were laid to rest shortly after.\n\nThese men and women had morals, and they weren't completely harmless. Whenever a dragon was killed, and a comrade was lost, they would carry them back to their homeland  and bury him properly, with a dragon tooth of the slain dragon rested upon their chest on a necklace. Vansing approved of all of his companions that fought below him, and so he paid them well for every single dragon that was killed. This charade continued for five straight years, and a total of four bronze dragons, eighteen black dragons and three blue dragons were killed. Each had a souvenier taken for Vansing's display in his bedroom, and it currently consisted of eighty nine dragon teeth and forty scales. He was a mighty Orc  and had a lot of achievements to show just how fierce he truly was.\n\nAfter his guild disbanded, Vansing returned to Orgrimmar to be with his clan, helping them with all of the wealth that he had earned with his dragon hunting career. After a year  he returned to his craft of Dragonslaying, now buffed with his superior might and vetaren experience, aiding him in solo-killing any dragon that he gazed upon.By the time he reached forty five years of age, he'd killed over twenty dragons with the help of his  prime might, with just his twin axes sunk into their neck. His armor was tempered with dragon blood and he wore it proudly no one had the death wish to cross this man. Time has passed and the day came where all black dragons were presumably gone extinct.Vansing retired since all other flights became neutral and hunting them would get him into trouble, so he retired from Dragonslaying and became a mercenary instead. To this day, all this Orc does is roam Orgrimmar with a bewitched stare rested on every man that gazed at him. Offering his work to anybody that pays the best. He was a killer, a fighter, and never failed a mission, so he offered his mercenary skills to whomever desired it.\n\n\n{/col}",

With square features, large bold nose, broad chin, small eyes. It might even stand out as handsome if it weren't for the glaring reddish scar on the right side of his face. An old burn wound that one might see if he ever took the mask off. His silver hair is often decorated, but let down. Occasionally pulled back into a lazy ponytail. \n\nHe doesn't boast the impressive musculature of the majority of his people. More lean, functional over form. Although his armor can change from time to time, he doesn't go without the strange orcish skull mask. Not out of a reluctance to hide his face, even if he doesn't wear it the mask hangs on his belt. Refusing to be without it.\n\nYet another of the sea of Zandalari whom made their way to the Horde, RI'kavek keeps his things modest. The armor he does keep is mended, repaired, and his weapons amaturely maintained. He isn't destitute, but he's not guady either.{/col}\n\n{h2}Personality{/h2}\n{col:83c8da}Quiet and stoic, he is never the life of the party but he does enjoy being included. Even if it's to listen to the others or feel like he's part of the crowd. Ri'kavek seems slow on the uptake for humor and jokes and unusually serious. Not that he hates them, but they tend to fly over his head.\n\nGetting along better with animals than other humanoids, Rika rarely goes anywhere without some companion of his. But his most stalwart is his old friend Zul'thun. One of the hatchlings he has had since his time working at the Warbeast Kraal. And he is more quick to trust those his friends take to, as well as those who keep beasts with them. His pet parrot, Humerus however is quick to add a bit of flavor and add his words to the conversation.\n\nWith his previous military service in the Fourth War, Rika boasts a discipline that he struggles to break. When it comes to talking about himself, he becomes rather tight lipped but with just a bit of goading he'll relent. But far too nervous to offer up any information willingly.{/col}\n\n{h2}History/RP Hooks{/h2}\n\n{col:83c8da}Born to the Warrior Caste with a Dinomancer mother and a Rastari Father, Ri'kavek lived a pretty ordinary life for the most part. Though as soon as his body was strong enough is body was trained to also enter tha warrior caste. But the quiet son was studious and sensitive enough to the loa his parents had the greatest aspirations he could become a priest. Yet despite their hopes Ri'ka wished to follow his mother's path to become a Dinomancer. Having always had an affinity for them over people.\n\nDespite his talents though, Ri'kavek was slow to complete his training when he had been kept home for a year having been said he was sick. After his recovery he had grown even more quiet and passive. But since he always did his job to the letter and didn't cause any problems. The animals also loved him.\n\nSeveral years later, Ri'kas had been convicted of second degree murder of his Father he had been granted a mercy from the sands in exchange for leaving for the Horde lands. Ri'kavek accept his sentence without much fuss and put his lot in with the Horde military joining the offense in the remainder of the Fourth War. Meeting his closest friend and rival; Irok Steellung. Though the two started at odds with the other and had a rivalry which pushed the other to improve to new heights. The two of them baffled by the others culture had made them clash but eventually came to an understanding.\n\nThe Laughing Skull fell in the war against N'zoth and Ri'kavek honored his friend and Rival in the Laughing Skull way. And adopting his beloved pet Humerus. Once the war had been brought to it's conclusion, Ri'kavek resigned and took up busywork where he could get it.\n\n{link*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekLpaZQLKfvuriwuy4QRIh7Md13-tckH3K9He1QntTs/edit?usp=sharing*In-depth backstory for those who like more!}\n\n\n{col:83c8da}You might recognize Ri'kavek if:\n*They have spent a number of time in the Warbeast Kraal before the 4th war\n*A fellow Zandalari may have heard of his sentence\n*Served in the Horde Military during the 4th war and against the Armies of N'Zoth{/col}\n\n{h2}OOC{/h2}\n{col:ffffff}Welcome to set up scenes, especially in the outside world! However, not looking for random erp.\n\nCharacter IS an exile, Zandalari are welcome to recognize and even treat him negatively for it. IC =/= OOC!\n\nDual Toon character. Usually stick to the hunter, but will occasionally see me on my druid. Dinomancers can turn into dinosaurs, but player personally thinks the beast taming part of them is more iconic/interesting.\n\nFind it weird that it needs to be clarified but player/character are LGBT friendly.{/col}\n\n{link*https://twitter.com/Uni_Fools*Twitter Link}",

					["TX"] = "  The tale of Gullandron begins sometime ago. Before the third war. Son of the noble Duskrunners; a family of night guardsmen since the Sin'dorei set foot in Eversong. As a young boy he was often cheerful, and intuitive, respectful and always did as he was told. at the age of 13 he was enlisted in the silvermoon training academy and by age 17 a Lieutenant of the Guard. He served alongside his father, Captain Thallandron Duskrunner; leading those nearly centuries older than himself. It wasnt long after that he met someone he truly related to and cared for, Syllira Silvermight.\n\n  On his first mission out of Quel'thalas he was set to escort a trade caravan to Stratholme. The caravan was ambushed by orc outriders. Though the young Lieutenants men were skilled, they were vastly outnumbered. They took defensive stance around the caravan but, were instantly surrounded.\nSuddenly, a barrage of meticulously placed arrows flew out of the trees. In moments the war party was slain. Out of the darkness a voice spoke, \"Be mindful of your wits Duskrunner, dawn approaches.\". 3 hooded figures proceeded out of the woods a pulled down their hoods. \"Ranger General Windrunner\", Gullandron said unsurprised. \"You would have been dead if not for Syllira's tracking.\". Looking over to the left of Sylvannas, he saw a young elf, with fair skin and Silver hair and glowing blue eyes. He had heard of the Silvermight family, only that they are of the few remaining High Elf Lineage from Kalimdor that retains nobility above others. \n\"Well, you have my gratitude ranger.\", Gullandron admitted. Syllira looked at the young Soldier and winked with a playful grin. \"Proceed with your mission, Lieutenant. Syllira, you will continue the trip to Stratholme with the caravan.\",Sylvannas ordered.\n\nOver the years, their paths countlessly crossed, and every time Gullandron saw the Ranger, she'd give hime that same look that she gave to him when she first met. Their chemistry grew and eventually they got married and had a child by the name of Vessana Duskrunner. \n\nGullandrons father was slain shortly after the birth of his daughter and was replaced by his son as Captain of the Guard. Though he mourned his fathers death, he felt blessed at the life he had found. Though rumors of an evil stirred South. Then Arthas...\n\nThe day the Scourge marched on Quel'thalas is a mournful memory for him. As Captain of the Guard he was incharge of bolstering most seige points. Though an excellent tactitian, he was not prepared for what happened next. \n\nGullandron wiped sweat from his face and placed his helm back on his head.\"Bolster the left gate, Sun Phalanx, I need Ballistas stationed on every tower to the east!\", Sin'dorei ran with purpose, quickly carrying out his orders. Suddenly a shadow fell over the city. The march outside the city walls rattled and echoed through  the walls of Silvermoon.. He knew, he felt, but did not want to believe what was about to come. The breach was imminent.\nThen screams of terror spread throughout the city. They had passed through, Civilians ran out of the saftey of their homes as chaos grew. He grabbed his elite and ran to the Inner city. An overhelming spawn had made its way in, Captain Gullandron intiated the Charge. Before the clash, a volley of arrows tore down the running horde. He looked up in the sky intently. Syllira leading a party of Rangers mounted on Dragon Hawks flew past. \"Go!! Get to General Windrunner!!\" she yelled. She looked down at her husband, \" It's Arthas, hes trying to take the Sunwell. You have to get to Vessana! Go!\" \n\n  Vessana had been taken to the Ranger Retreat, North-East of the City. He made sure the line of defense was reformed, then left his Senior Seargant in Charge. He quickly advanced to the nearest sewer entrance and Escaped to the front of the gates. He thought his eyes betrayed him as he looked to the West and saw the biggest force he had ever seen. He stood in shock for a moment and then ran towards the Retreat. He reached the Ranger haven by nightfall, but upon arrival there was no one to be found. He entered and began to investigate. Then he heard running behind him, he quickly turned around prepared to fight, but it wasnt fast enough. Arms embrased Gullandron, it was Syllira. \"Gullandron...\" she muttered, \"Sylvanas is dead.\".  He looked into her blue eyes with sadness, \" ..and the Sunwell?\", he asked. Syllira shook her head. They both looked at the abandoned Safe Haven and wondered what couldhave happened, where did they go? They began to look for clues, in hope that their daughter was still alive.\nGullandron then heard a sound come from up stairs, he bolted! When he reached the top of the stairs he heard a really sharp sound, in unison with a sharp prick in his neck. He began to feel sick and fade, his sight was going. He fell and hit the ground.  \n\n\n        \n\n",

There the priestesses raised her in the image of their order, though she proved to be a bit rambunctious and hard to control. Eventually, as a young Kaldorei, and after running away from the only home she ever knew far too many times, Belaurosa set off on her own to find her own path, and has been journeying across the all of Azeroth ever since. \n\nShe spent the first few centuries of her life getting to know the all of Kalimdor, meeting people - and foes - all across the continent. Now, after the many wars that have brought the Alliance together, Belaurosa finds herself in the company of humans, dwarves, gnomes, and all manner of strange and interesting folk. Every adventure seems to bring on new horizons, an ever expanding realm of possibilities at her feet.{/p} \n\nOOC notes:\n\n- Though a monk, Bela took up the discipline far before ever journying to Pandaria. Her style and their style aren't quite the same, though she did learn a thing or two from the pandaren that have proven very useful!\n- pretty much always ooc if dressed in full tier or in elaborate monk transmogs dgsdg\n- corruption is obviously ooc\n",

Her skin is as pale as the moon, free from blemishes or scars. The female has very pretty and delicate features for someone who is in combat often. Her nose and mouth are a little small while her eyes are the average for Sin'dorei elf but radiate a soft blue-green mist color. \n{/col} \n\n{col:9bcdff}Kasumi, unlike most elves who are born with long skin ears, was born with a pair of black and white fox ears along with a twenty-five-inch fox tail. Her ears and tail have full movement, Kasumi's ears bending down when sad and erecting tall when happy or curious. Kasumi's tail motion is similar to her ears in the way you can see her emotions. The fluffy extrusion wagging when happy or hanging limp when sad. The tail is white from the base until about five inches from the tip where the fur changes to black while her ears are white from the base but change to a deep black at the top. Inside there is a patch of fluffy white fur as well.\n{/col}\n\n    {h1:c}{col:ff70f9}~Body~{/col}{/h1}\n{col:9bcdff}Kasumi's body is surprisingly slim for someone who spends her day's healing, her feminine features unique. Her hips were slightly below average while her butt is in a small round shape. Her breasts are a 29 B cup with a round shape. Her whole body like her face is a pale color and free of any blemishes or scars. On her back a few small tattoos could be seen in a misty color, the shapes being small inch long fox paw tracks trailing from her lower back to her right shoulder. \n\n\n{h1:c}{col:ff70f9}~Art~{/col}{/h1}\n \n\n{h1:c}{link*https://imgur.com/a/WIpsk4c*Kassy's Art}{/h1}\n",

His caravan was good at what they did they even participated in the battle of dazralor running supplies to the front and taking wounded troops to get aid. life was good and his caravan p0rospered. Until one-days they were ambushed by pirates and taken captive. he was tortured for weeks maybe even months when the pirates found they had nothing worth taking they brutally killed all the members oft he caravan even the vixens and the kits including his wife and daughter. the pirates must of grew board because all they did was throw him over board where he floated on block of ice. he eventually found a wrecked alliance ship and fashioned a raft out of the wood. he floated for many months at sea surviving on rain water and sea birds-until he washed ashore on kalimdor. Since then he has spend his time rebuilding his life which he has done to great success thought it will never be as good as it once was.  \n\nNote: since some people seem to have an issue my RP style I will be clear. he is gentleman by nature this is purely IC never OOC and he can get very affectionate to people he likes and considers friends. If this bothers you say something like a mature responsible adult don't keep it to yourself or\" drop hints\" or play the\"just ignore him\" game Like a rude spoiled snowflake. this isn't high school and i don't have respect for people who play those kinda games. Also he is VERY polite and likes to give compliments and praise. If you feel this is considered\"being hit on\" then you need to get over yourself.

He is very quick to show off his tattoos if doubted and only shows his scars if he feels his honor has been tarnished. Though once known he is a very loyal and absolute individual, he speaks his mind and has no issue telling others how he feels about them or his actions. His friends are often quick to apologize for him in polite company, the Vrykul truly does not understand that he can come off as insulting. There is only action to him and he very much lives in the moment and rarely plans for the future, often lending him into awkward and sometimes dangeorus situations. Skjoldur is a loyalist at heart and it is incredibly rare for him to invoke violence or aggression onto other members of the horde. Though this can often be a surprise to some who believe Skjoldur to be nothing more than a simple minded brute.\n\nClothing\n\nIf seen out in the world Skjoldur is often wearing a full Vrykul battle warriors set with an oversized and very worn out Horde tabard, perhaps kept red from redying or from all the blood that the warrior has shed for his nation. He was known as The Flag in the Horde military and would often be seen with a large banner strapped to a pole attached to the back of his body. But when seen off the battlefield in the cities or abouts the outskirts of Thunderbluff where he often travels, he would be seen very differently. His large plate armor given up for a light linen tunic. The often hunched warrior instead stands proud with his back straight and head raised to the sky, often still choosing to wear a red tunic or leather jacket in the colder seasons. But often still wearing simple loose linen pants, but what is absent in every case other than war is that the Vrykul is always shoeless. The large oafs huge and fairly hairy feet are given free reign to the world and are often gawked at, though Skjoldur is convinced this is actually a compliment and will very often wink, happily and contently attempting to \"Show off\" His feet to any would be onlookers",

Her caravan known as the Silvertail Caravan had many teachers who were capable of teaching various different types of magical practices.\n\nShe was very quick to pick up on almost all of them, each magical practice however was something she never quite managed to master as her abilities were far outside those taught by the elders of the Silvertail Caravan.\n\nHer magic caused ripples around her as she tried various different teachings and eventually it became clear she was capable of using Time Magic, something the caravan was not equipped to teach so she found herself leaving the caravan after many years to find a teacher.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ffa700}After the Fall of The Dawnlight{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ff00e3}Marah found herself at a loss, unable to figure out where she wanted to go in life but she knew she had to keep going. Her ideals were still in tact even though her heart was broken, reluctantly she continued on.\n\nReaching Dazar'alor, she ended up making friends with the Zandalari due to her natural ability to speak Zandali because of where she grew up. The more friends she made the more her name started being talked about amongst their people, to which lead to a keen interest in what type of magic she wielded.\n\nOver time the word spread and eventually while she had come to call Dazar'alor home, A member of the Bronze Dragon Flight approached her. Wishing to ensure she was properly trained to handle the type of magic she wielded for without proper training time magic could wreak devastation.\n\nAt first her magic was dangerous, having various different ripples occur with each of her teachings and even at one point causing a distortion around her. Over time she was brought to the Caverns of Time to continue her training in a safe environment with masters capable of instructing her better.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:ffa700}A True Prodigy{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ff00e3}The more she learned from the masters in the Caverns of Time, the more they saw greatness in her. Along with her ideals and her caring nature, Marah would bring about a legacy for her two Caravan's that would stand the test of time.\n\nWhile she would face trials and tribulations along the way, the masters entrusted to her the knowledge they did while also instructing her to never stray from her ideals no matter how difficult at times it maybe.\n\nOne of the major requirements for her however was to unlearn any prior teachings and devote herself to the teachings of the Bronze Dragon Flight, something of which she struggled with for some time.\n\nTaught the nature of Time Magic, Marah's abilities went increasingly far but with every teaching she learned her magic was not damaging. Something that went right along with her core morals, this became her staple from then on.{/col}{/p}\n\n{h3:c}{col:ffa700}--------------------------------------------------------------------{/col}{/h3}\n\n{h1:c}{col:ffa700}OOC Notes!{/col}{/h1}\n\n{p:c}{col:ff00e3}I am well aware of the nature of Time Magic and others desires to not interact with characters like this but I request you give it a go! \n\nI actively avoided writing anything revolving around personality or appearance, it's relativity will never remain constant.\n\nOOC communcation for me key and the effort put into Marah is something I take great pride in.\n\nWhile I love goofing around OOCly, I also try to be respectful of other RPers. That being said! If you want respect then you must earn it, treat me disrespectfully and you will find your actions being mirrored.\n\nTwo last notes: I am a paragraph RPer, so I respond slow and thoughtful. But!

His overall physique gives the impression of a soldier who has seen his share of the front lines of war.\n\nEven bronze skin contrasts with his fair coloured hair; light ash blond and a bit unruly, it's often properly styled and coiffed away from his face. A few silver strands are blended in with the platinum locks, hinting at both age and a weathered life.  His transitioning green-gold eyes seem guarded and cold, giving very little insight as to how he may be feeling, or what he may be thinking. A strong, square jawline, straight nose, and high cheekbones lend to his unyielding appearance. \n\nWhether he's dressed in armour or clad in embroidered cloths and leathers, his attire is adjusted or tailored to fit his form.  No matter what he’s wearing, a gold ring always adorns his left hand.\n\nHis long stride and squared shoulders fit the apparent soldier-theme of this man, carrying himself with the usual airs of arrogance that might be expected of a Blood Knight.  His expression is generally neutral, his mannerisms almost suggesting that there are a few core emotions missing from his make-up.{/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sunlight:512:10}\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffc300}· G E N E R A L · I N F O R M A T I O N ·{/col}{/h2}\n{col:ffed9e}·Someone with the ability to catch glimpses into the souls of others might notice that {col:ffc300}half of his appears to be missing...{/col}\n\n·If anyone knows {col:ffc300}Dravenn Tel'athain{/col}, the resemblance between the two is striking.\n\n\n\n{p:c}{col:ffc300}Familiarity may be assumed if your character:{/col}{/p}\n\n{col:ffed9e}·Has current ties to the {col:ffc300}Blood Knights{/col} or old ties to the {col:ffc300}Silvermoon City Guard{/col}.\n\n·Has served in the military, specifically in Northrend, Outland, the Isle of Quel'Danas, or during the Third and Fourth Wars.\n\n·Attends weekly services at the church of the Light.\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\PETBATTLES\\Weather-Sunlight:512:10}\n\n{h2:c}{col:ffc300}· N O T E S ·{/h2}\n{col:ffed9e}The 'Lieutenant Commander' title was a field commission given to him through his unit of command in Northrend, which he has been allowed to keep upon returning.

It is an expression devoid of true mirth, and for the keen eye it’s shown to be nothing more than a masquerade for the honed awareness that only prolonged time spent in the rigors of war can produce. Though she might move with the comfortable poise of an individual content at rest, there is always an innate sense of tension about her; a glowing ember but a breath away from exploding into inferno.\n\nSolstice’s form is willowy and narrow boned; brute strength is obviously not hers to weild. Instead she possesses the limber sleekness of an acrobat, the modest curves that she does have carefully enhanced by the fit of her clothing or a tightly laced corset. Tall and long-legged, she can easily look most male Sin’dorei in the eye with little problem, a feat made all the more easy by her penchant for stiletto heels. Her ivory complexion borders on the pallid, bereft of color in a way that is often seen in the mortally ill or those touched by some insidious magic. It is easy to discern a case of the latter, as her eyes are shrouded beneath raving emerald fire in the obvious tell of heavy fel corruption. \n\nSculpted, high cheekbones cut an aristocratic elegance to her features, their prominence softened by a dainty nose and delicately tapered chin. A kiss of artfully applied cosmetics play up the stark contrast of her burning gaze and porcelain skin in smoldering kohl, her lips adorned in similar dramatic fashion with crimson or plum. Jet colored curls fall just beneath her shoulder blades when left unbound, though her preference is to keep them tamed into an elaborate bun with jeweled pins. \n\nCombat has not left her unscathed, and if visible her back is twisted in a horrific web of burn scars. From the base of her spine to the nape of her neck and onto her shoulders the skin is warped and disfigured, the product of some gruesome injury long mended but irreversible in its evidence.{/col}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-warlock-skullofthemanari:512:256}\n\n{h2:c}{col:f9adff}Public Knowledge/Possible RP Hooks:{/col}{/h2}\n{icon:inv_icon_wing01e:25}{col:c60887}Bastard daughter of Lord Vaedoran Cindersoul, the late Marquis of the southern Eversong (now a plagued ruin) and his then mistress, the famed courtesan Bellia Coldrune. The origins of her birth are both a sore subject and a matter of pride, the mingled shame of being illegitimate constantly warring against the satisfaction of clawing to where she has risen today despite it.{/col}\n\n{icon:ability_bossmagistrix_timewarp1:25}{col:ae93ff}Formerly of the Sunfury elite, Solstice served as part of the force stationed within Tempest Keep during the years of the Sin’dorei exodus to the Outlands. After sustaining grave injuries and enduring capture following the siege of the Keep and Prince Kael’Thas’ death she was placed on trial alongside the other Sunfury survivors. The magistrix managed to obtain a pardon with assistance from her father, a respected Blood Knight, but her life came at a cost. For the years to come she was sent to the forefront of any military campaigns the Horde took part in, thrown into the worst conditions and deadliest battlefields each engagement had to offer. This has had an impact on both her skill and her temperament, leaving her notoriously short fused among her peers and vicious in battle against her enemies.{/col}\n\n{icon:inv_misc_gem_amethyst_01:25}{col:f9adff}Solstice has fuck you money and is utterly unapologetic about it. Following the death of her father during the years of the Pandaria campaign she was left his entire estate, a shocking inheritance for a bastard daughter but the only logical choice for her father who had lost both of his legitimately born heirs during the Scourge invasion. Instead of retiring to a life of luxury or delving into the more traditional outlets of angst, Solstice decided to channel her daddy issues into further increasing her wealth. She sold off her father’s lands and estates, liquidating all of the assets and then reinvesting them into promising opportunities. A gamble that paid off surprisingly well, and as she showed more and more acuity for venture capitalism she earned a reputation for being just as ruthless when it came to business as warfare. More than one noble family has had their fortunes scattered by her hands, and carefully keeping the bulk of her assets in neutral territories and banks ensures that retaliation has yet to scathe her.{/col}\n\n\n",

He's been using his power to fight for the Horde, but has also been learning the art of healing as well. \n\nThe Tribal does not speak Orcish well, so he is often speaking in a different language then most understand, but other Vulpera are able to understand it just fine. Thanks to the spell of one of his companions, he is able to understand what is being told to him by others in Orcish, but he is unable to speak it well himself yet.  \n\nRokeel has learned that the interests of his people are far different than what he is used to from his tribe, yet he enjoys those same interests. He's also enjoyed learning about the other races of the world and getting to learn from the shamen who have even higher understanding of the elements than his elders did. \n\nCurrently, Rokeel works with a group of other Vulpera to go to dangerous places and fight for the Shadowlands.

To truly understand Chän as an individual, however, you have to grasp these two seemingly contradictory sides to his character.  He is not one or the other.  He is not one and then the other.  He is both.  Typically, one side of his character is more prominent than the other, depending on the circumstances, but it should always be remembered that, behind all the sophistication and refinement, behind his carefully polished professional exterior, Chän is, and always, will be a fiery, passionate soul who wholeheartedly embraces his “Animal nature.”  He is not ashamed of his lustfulness and eroticism.\n\n{h3:c}Chän, the Sophisticated Socialite{/h3}\nMost of the time, Chän goes about as a sophisticated socialite; \"Chän the Lawyer\", \"Chän the Professional\", \"Chän the Well-to-do\" - he is typically well-dressed, carefully groomed, reasonably well-mannered, and strives to make an overall good impression on those around him - not least of all when they could be potential clients, or a female requiring a more delicate and romantic seduction.  The said, his erotic playfulness often bleeds through in the form of innuendo and suggestion.\n\n{h3:c}Chän, the Lustful Rapscallion{/h3}\n\n{h3:c}<The Virile Chän>{/h3}\nChän’s virility (hence, “Virile Chän”) fuels a fairly prominent dominant streak in his personality – and it is this dominant streak in his personality that has ushered him into the status of an Alpha Fox.  He has a commanding presence, boundless confidence, unwavering self-esteem, an intoxicating “Joie de vivre”, an attractive magnetic personality, a smoldering gaze, an electrifying touch, and absolutely no shame.  He is animated by a wild, indomitable, and fiery passion.  He knows how to put that “Fire” into his gaze, into his touch, and into his words.  He knows how to get what he wants – and he’s not afraid to do so.  As an Alpha Fox, Chän feels that it is both his right and duty to procreate at an alarming rate.  He considers that all of the females as far as his eyes can see are, at least potentially, “His” and should naturally be willing partners.  Of course, they may or may not agree with this sentiment – especially if they are not a Vulpera, and do not recognize the status of an Alpha Fox.\n\n{h3:c}<The Illustrious Prince Chän>{/h3}\nOne of Chän’s newest claims is that he is, in fact, a Prince.  Whether or not this is actually true doesn’t seem to make a difference to him – he still expects to be treated like the royalty he claims to be.\n\n{h3:c}<The Cult of the Red Rocket>{/h3}\n???\n\n{h2:c}Criminal History{/h2}\nChän's criminal history is surprisingly spotless - it's almost as if he paid somebody off to make this criminal history disappear.\n\n{h2:c}PAID ADVERTISEMENT{/h2}\nDid somebody piss in your cornflakes this morning?  If so, then call on <The Law Office of Chän, Esq.> and sue somebody today!\n\n\"By the time I'm done with your case, I'll own somebody!\" (Chän, Esq.).\n\n{h2:c}PAID ADVERTISEMENT{/h2}\nAre you too lazy to walk over to the local vendors to buy milk?  Would you rather it just show up in your mailbox?  Well then, you're in luck!  <Chän's Mail Milk> is here for you!\n\n1. Send Chän a letter indictating how many glasses of his milk you'd like\n2. Send 5g/glass of milk indicated\n3. Wait...\n4. Enjoy!\n\n*May contain traces of nuts\n\n\"<Chän's Mail Milk> - it's not what you think!\" (Chän, CEO).\n\n{h2:c}Services{/h2}\nLegal consultation and representation (including, but not limited to: permits, licenses, and other misc. contracts), insurance packages - personal or business, and bank loans.  Specializing in marriage licenses, pre-nups, divorce proceedings, satisfying your disappointed wife, etc.; Chän is your one-stop-shop for all of your marital legal needs!  Interested?\n\n{h3:c}NEW!{/h3}\nChän is now offering more services than ever before!  You can now pursue investing services (both short-term [i.e.: gambling] and long-term [i.e.: schemes])!\n\n*No guarantee of returns on investment; invest at your own risk!\n\n{h2:c}Closing Statements{/h2}\nSome people swear by Chän's services; some suspect that he's little more than a smoothing-talking con-artist; others suspect that he's running a full-blown criminal enterprise, and that his businesses are nothing but fronts for illegal activities - however, none of those allegations have stuck.  \n\nChän’s eyes sparkle with a lascivious fire as he grins.  “Like it or not, I’m here to plant my flag and conquer new territory.  Remember this: I always win.”",

He usually wears rather intricate silvered leather armor. The typical faintly glowing tattoos that cover his body end just over his eyes and wind their way down around his arms, chest, waist and legs. He tends to wear his longer hair loose.\n\n{h1:c}History{/h1}\nTilont was born to a rather well-off family in Suramar and for millenia he enjoyed the good life. When the Legion arrived that suddenly changed. His house was divded, his parents siding with Elisande but Tilont, who up to that point had been a bit of layabout suddenly realized that it could no longer go on. His disagreement with his parents over the Legion lead to them eventually throwing him out of the house and sending assassin's to try and have him killed to cover up the dissent for fear of their own lives and the house. Tilont managed to flee them with some help and eventually escaped the city. For months he was Nightfallen on his own, scraping by and subject to the withdrawals all Nightfallen faced. Eventually though he made contact with the rebellion and began to get the help he needed. He began to train in infiltration work and by the end of the war in Suramar, he was well developed into his role as an operator.\n\nWith the Nightborne joining the Horde he found his skills still in high demand and put them to work with zeal for his new people. Tilont often spends time in the field, he has perfected his Darnassian and often spends time in the Alliance cities masquerading as a Night Elf with the help of a little magic. He also infiltrated the Loyalist camp and fed information to Thalryssa and the other members of the resistance during the 2nd Horde Civil War. He also served in the Uldum campaign against N'zoth, taking out high ranking members of the Old God's forces.\n\n{h1:c}Current Events{/h1}\nWith the war for Azeroth's future moving into the Shadowlands, Tilont now finds himself working for forces that no one truly understands yet, himself included. And yet also finds himself inexplicably drawn to the Kyrian by their sense of duty and loyalty to their cause. What the Kyrian lack in spycraft, he has made up for, serving them both against the Forsworn and the forces of the Maw.\n",

She has long, pitch black hair (from which her family's surname stems), exceptionally pale, fair, clear skin, deep purple eyes, full red lips, a small cherry nose, and round cheeks that flush red at the slightest embarrassment. Her sparkling white teeth shine brilliantly when she smiles a smile that lights up any room she’s in. Not exactly an athlete, she has a particularly soft figure, curvy and plump in a couple areas, with a soft, squishy, but still more or less flat abdomen that creases deeply across the middle once when she sits. Wide hips and 38DD breasts protrude from over and under a somewhat slimmer waistline.\n\nA vain young woman, her girly-girl nature is featured prominently in the way her long, luxurious ebony hair shimmers in any light, and her nails are often painted black or deep purple. A charcoal eye shadow, however, is her only nod toward makeup. She generally prefers dresses to pants and shirts, and is rarely ever seen wearing anything else. She prefers black and purple in her garb, though she will, on occasion, wear something a bit lighter.\n\nAmong her other girlish tendencies are several additional adornments. She has a simple choker necklace about her pale neck, from which a purple crystal hangs. A hoop adorns her left brow and the left side of her nose. She wears a ring on her right hand that bears a large black gem which glows faintly in the darkness, casting a dim, soft, dark purple glow on the immediate couple of feet around it. Under specific situations, this ring will glow far more brilliantly. In her pocket is a pocket watch with Kaldorei designs on it. She checks this often when she knows she is due somewhere soon. Two charm bracelets adorn her left wrist. One is leather, with Kaldorei runes for \"Clothing\" and \"Home\" on them. The other is a truesilver bracelet with a rectangular charm hanging from it. A closer look is needed to see the inscription on back and engraved picture on front. The same goes for the inscription on a dark hairpin with butterflies bedecked in amethysts, a pin she particularly seems to treasure.{/col}\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/v9uY3YU.png*CHARACTER ART!

As before, art by the incredibly talented Lady Kat!}\n\n{h2:c}{col:a134ff}Activities{/col}{/h2}\n\n{col:d7d6ff}When spotted doing a Tarot reading, she withdraws a small cherrywood card case from a black leather pack with a spider web embroidered upon it in silver thread. The cherrywood case has an underlying hint of purple due to the wood used. She also positions a dreamy-looking pale sapphire-colored spread-cloth with swirling, shiny pearl thread patterns embroidered in. The spread-cloth is positioned to point a corner at either participant, giving it a diamond-shape. She places a deck of cards upon this cloth that have black backs with intricate dark purple designs.\n\nWhen dicing, like with her favorite game, Deathrolls, she uses a set of pitch-black dice with large, thick, dark purple numbers engraved into them. These dice are cast with a clatter and a giggle from her small, dainty hands.\n\nWhen walking, she seems awkward, and yet, she unintentionally has an alluring slow wiggle of the hips and a slow, constant roll of her heavy bosom. When running (which she rarely does), she appears a total spaz, as though she has two left feet, her curves jigging in an embarrassing and unflattering manner. Just watch for a moment, and you'll see her fall down on her face with a squeak and a blush. When riding, she rides sidesaddle, be it ground or air. This seems to be far more of a natural and smooth form of travel for her than walking, and especially running.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:a134ff}Other Senses{/col}{/h2}\n\n{col:d7d6ff}Her scent is generally a mix of lavender and goldthorn. Occasional additional scents might include the faintest hint of woodsmoke, a hot, delicious meal she made, a somewhat less faint hint of Dwarven mead, or the natural, woodsy, earthy smell of Duskwood.\n\nWhen she speaks, her voice is a bell-like tinkle of a young, girlish alto, one that often giggles or stammers depending upon who is talking to her and what is being said. Her voice is a happy sound, one that brings to the subconscious mind a feeling of peace and calm and unending youthful joy.\n\nIf touched, one would feel either her silky, clean, luxurious ebon locks, or else feel silky smooth, perfectly moisturized skin. Most of her features would feel soft and a little squishy to the touch. If clothing is touched, any number of a wide variety of materials might be felt, depending on her dress or outfit of the day.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:a134ff}Approaching Nat{/col}{/h2}\n\n{col:d7d6ff}Approaching her can generate any number of results – the gleeful, giggling greeting and possibly a hug for good friends, a fearful shrinking away and a stammering voice if the approaching individual seems frightening, or a stammering, shy, nervous demeanor if the individual walking up is a completely new stranger (though, if they’re friendly, she’ll warm up to them soon enough!).\n\nIn essence, Natasha Ebonlocke appears, upon first inspection, one who clearly enjoys a happy, cushy life. She’s girly, slightly vain, happy, and giggly. She’s a young woman who will befriend anyone, and doesn’t appear to have a mean bone in her body. Approach her if you like – you may just make a loyal, devoted friend for life!{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:a134ff}RP Hooks{/col}{/h2}\n\n{col:d7d6ff}You may know Natasha if:\n\n ~ you frequent Stormwind City, and have seen her wandering about, hanging out with groups of people various sizes, sitting at a table with them with a stein of mead in front of her, talking or eating or playing Deathrolls with them.\n\n ~ you did business with Blackflag Imports in some capacity before the company closed.\n\n ~ you have heard of her Tarot readings from someone.\n\n ~ you frequent Darkshire or Duskwood, where you see her in her quieter setting, where she works hard in the Town Hall, where she visits the tavern to see a few friends there, and where she lives in the house on the edge of town that's closest to Karazhan.\n\n ~ you frequent Ironforge, where she semifrequently visits pubs there with friends.\n\n ~ if you think... she looks like... someone... but no, that woman on the Broken Isles, or the Shadowlands, was surrounded by hordes of demonic mininons, and she had a far more confident and determined look on her face than this timid little young woman does... and yet... {/col}\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warboard-classic-Duskwood:512:256}\n",

Upon landing on the shores of the Twilight Highlands Vy'theas and the entire ship crew were taken prisoner by none other than the Twilight's Hammer. After much of the crew were killed off or still be tortured Vy'theas proved to be the most gifted one. He withstood their torture longer than most and was soon tested on his fighting skills, agility, stamina, and intellect. The cult finally came to a conclusion to keep Vy'theas alive but start the process of mentally reconditioning him to where he would serve as a perfect tool for them in every aspect. He was soon the perfect assassin, best tracker, and most obediant slave. All it took was the same sequence of words spoken to him in the correct order, the same order that was said to him during his reconditioning. Once the words were said, he was theirs to control. Now since the fall of the Twilight's Hammer he has been freed from his chains to them but his mind is still very much theirs, or anyone else's. All is needed is to say the right words. Recently he has just learned that the Twilight's Hammer had him kill his whole family and all his friends so they couldn't rid him of any chance to his mind recondtioning. WIP\n\n\n",

She had a keen nact for explortation to the point where she went all across pandaria, staying for short bursts of times in different villages.\n\nBut everything changed once the forces of the alliance and the horde brought their war to pandarias borders.

He stands at twelve feet tall and is rather muscular, even for a druid. Despite his rather large and intimidating frame he rarely shows a face of intimidation and his eyes always seem rather calm, laid back and even friendly when you start to speak with him. You will be hard pressed to find him in public without his self made totem that he holds dear and shows designs about his family. In addition to that he is found in traditional Tauren garb including his headdress and either a kilt or a loincloth. He also has tradtional druidic markings on his chest and face. He usually lets his mane grow out a bit and has a triple braid under his chin as well as feathers on either side of his head. He wears a totem necklace given to him by his mother when he was young and holds it dear to him. He also wears a flower in his hair. If you see him without his headdress you will see a headband with a gemstone, made for him by his father.{/col}\n\n{col:ffffff}RP hooks:\nKoth grew up in Bloodhoof Village, feel free to know him from there in the past\nHe trained under Archdruid Runetotem\nHelped out during the Legion invasion and during the Fourth War\nUsed to be seen around Orgrimmar a lot\nStill seen around Thunder Bluff every so often\nOn occasion going back to continue his training to learn more healing to this day\n{/col}\n\n\nMore to come in the future\n\n{col:ff0000}-OOC stuff and info-{/col}\n{col:ffffff}Themes I am most interested in: Long term, story driven, slice of life, romantic.

I myself am not picky about post length and am not bothered by typos, it's not like I don't do them myself.\nNo combat RP, please.\nTaking initiative and being confident gets you places.\nRP is a two way street, don't ghost me and let me know what I'm doing wrong if I do something you don't like it. I can be adaptable if you tell me what to do. Don't expect me to read your mind, nobody can do that as much as some of you desperately want it. Learn some communication skills ffs. \nMature themes are story driven only\nLet's get out of the city to RP, Orgrimmar RP is boring \nNo, I do not use growth pots and never will despite Koth being twelve feet tall.\nIf it matters that much I am male IRL\nF-List avalible on request for those who are 18+ and interested in long term\nPolitics in TRP will be ignored promptly{/col}\n\n\n",

He's incredibly massive and clearly bulked up thanks to heavy fel use. His skin is a deep, rich, green and is barren of any scarring save for a thin scar running between his pectorals. His body is abnormally muscular even by warlock standards as his pecs have with unnatural might, and his biceps swell out with thick veins pumping demonically empowered blood through them\n\nDespite being a warlock, Nothogg looks more than capable of hoisting up two fully armored Orc men and tossing them a good distance. His body is, appropriately, tattooed quite heavily in demonic runes and curving lines. Most noticeable is a crest of the Black Harvest on his left shoulder. Nothogg has little shame about his physique and will even flex his hulking muscles to show off his body for others, men in particular.\n\nNothogg's face is more or less what you would expect from a hulked out Warlock. Strong jawed and hypermasculine in the extreme. Nothogg has a long beard of deep purple hair combined with a sharply spiked mohawk of violet. The sides of the mohawk are braided, but the rest is left to fall behind him in a legitimately impressive mane of purple hair that reaches to his knees.\n\nNothogg's eyes are a vivid purple that match his hair perfectly, though his fel tainting has left his eyes sclera as black as his pupils, while his violet irises gleam brightly. This gives his eyes a distinct and spooky look to them that's made more emphatic by the short onyx horns rising from his forehead. Nothogg keeps them neatly polished and often adorned with rings or caps of silver to look more appealing. Sprouting from Nothogg's back are a pair of demonic wings large enough and strong enough to allow for flight. Nothogg typically keeps them hidden to avoid frightening townsfolk and to make wearing clothes easier on him.\n\nNothogg's style of dress is, while obviously a warlock, not very \"edgy\" to put it bluntly. He tends to dress casually in clothes you would expect most orcish civilians and spell casters of the Shadowmoon clan to wear. Often these clothes are adorned with accessories and such that will easily identify him as a warlock to those in need of his services without coming across as excessively diabolical or frightening to normal people. As a shadowmoon his clothes favor purples, whites, blues, greys, and browns. All of which serve to provide him a more modest and approachable appearance despite his profession. Likewise his clothing is loose fit to give Nothogg a degree of flexibility and motion to accommodate his bulk more easily and show off his physique to others.",

						["TX"] = "As a warlock and member of The Black Harvest, Nothogg is predictably quite abrasive and disrespectful to most people. In particular he has a strong contempt for authority figures and leadership and will not hesitate to ignore or refuse the commands of anyone who tries to boss him around. The only people Nothogg unconditionally respects is his husband and The Black Harvest council leadership, and the second one is on a situational basis.\n\nAs a scholar and researcher for The Black Harvest, Nothogg is capable of being far more eloquent than you would expect such a brash and foul mouthed man, and often shows a more tender side around novice magic users. His efforts at teaching often contain a less hostile and more jovial form of harshness or abrasion paired with a clear enjoyment of seeing others learn to wield the forces of sorcery.\n\nIn many ways Nothogg can seem like a backwards warlock. He's more often modest and down to earth where others are cackling and maniacal. His treatment of fel is likewise the same respectful and mathematical approach used by mages to the arcane forces. His more analytical approach shows through actions over words how the forces of fel are just as much a natural force and a tool that can be invaluable when handled with the respect and caution warranted by it.\n\nWith other warlocks, mages, or studious types Nothogg's abrasion softens into something far more earnest and passionate. His interests are not restricted to hellfire and demonology, magical study of any kinds perk his interest. When he gets engaged and rambling on a particular topic, you can see his eyes light up all too much like a young and excitable orc boy half his age.",

It appears to have been stiched and restiched, patched and repatched over it's long use. His arms and dusty footpaws are wrapped in tan cloth for support during lengthy travel.  His bow gives him away as an archer and the large wolf he typically travels with indicates an affinity towards beasts.

Only his striking amber eyes peering out at the world in cautious appraisal.  Braids of coarse fur adorn the mask and provide warmth and camoflage which seems to be his armor's primary purpose. It's practical but not very fashionable. His only piece of decoration appears to be a wolf-head amulet made of silver with pale blue gems for eyes that hangs on a sturdy chain around his neck. {/col}\n\n{col:248c5b}--On his back is a simple travlelers pack stuffed with odds and ends to aid in survival along with bundled pelts to be traded in towns and cities he reluctantly vists. This could very well be all the posessions he has.  A quiver of arrows, a short bow (a longbow in the paws of a Vulpera) and a walking stick/glaive serve as his weapons. The rest he gathers and hunts.{/col}\n\n{col:007348}--Almost always at his side or lurking nearby is a large, healthy and dangerous looking wolf of one variety or another.Each are distinct in personality and behavior but more often than not he travels with a large, healthy wolfess named River who is fiercely defensive of her hunter.

She is infact ancient but you couldn't tell by looking at her. Her skin is a healthy colorful pink, her hair a rich plant-like green, and her eyes twinkle like little white stars. The visage she bears is one of welcoming and comfort, showing the gentle soul which lies within.\n\nThe lovely fresh fragrance of flowers emits off her person, at times she is literally covered in them. Her energy is raditant and brings out the natural beauty of the world around her.\n\nShe stands tall and proud with good posture. Nicely toned muscles line her body, showing off all the walking she does. A shapely backside which fills out her pants very well, so much that it could be a shelf. Wide hips are a prominent feature of the elf, no doubt perfect for the many occasions of childbearing she does.  Add in a hefty full bust sitting atop of her curvy torso and there she is!\n\n{h3:c}{link*https://imgur.com/602rOx1* Nela Art}{/h3}\n{h3:c}{link*https://i.imgur.com/U65FgNf.jpg*Nela Art 2 Newest}{/h3}\n{h3:c}{link*https://i.imgur.com/p5u8M0E.jpg*Nela Art! NSFW! Use Discretion.}{/h3}\n{h2}Personality Traits{/h2}\n{col:4cff4f}Nelaleria is a very kind and compassionate person. She treasures life and nature and always considers how her actions affect the world around her. A very conserving person, she never takes too much and prefers to ensure a balance between consumption and regrowth of nature. She is an advocate for non-violence and will do all she can to avoid unecassary pain and death.\n\nAs part of her compassion and reverence for life, she pays extra care to the most innocent of living things. She does care about adult people yes, but intensely cares for children with higher precedence. Along with her care of young children she also highly cares for animals, particularly small animals.\n\nWhen it comes to romantic things, Nela is very open to partners of all sorts. She divorces sexual encounters with emotional love commitment which makes her one to sleep with whomever she finds attractive. Her relationship preference would be for another female, but is attracted to males and females physcially alike.\n\nOne thing she has been known for is her often sage-like advice. She takes pleasure in being able to help others with guidance and is like a spiritual mother to others, along with being a physcial mother to many. {/col}\n\n{h2}Background{/h2}\n{col:4cff4f}Nelaleria hails from Feralas, almost all the way back to the Kaldorei empire days but no record of her birth is around today to be sure. At an early age she had an affinity for nature and a bond with animals which led her into the path of druidry.\n\nFor millennia she has been a roamer, always traveling the lands to help wherever she can and also just to take in the beauty of the natural world. Rarely has she settled down, and even when she does it's never too long before she took herself back on the unbeaten path.\n\nNela has had her fair share of adventures but it would be best to get to know her to hear of them. {/col}\n\n{h2}Other{/h2}\n{col:4cff4f}Nela has a very abnormal feature about her, she has three wombs which are each functional. It means she can have three seperate pregnancies going on at the same time.\nShe often is pregnant thrice at the same time, usually being a surrogate mother for others as well as endangered animals, yes I said animals.\n\nShe has a very high number of biological offspring due to the unfettered love-making she does and her incredibly high fertility rate. If you wish to have a toon be one of her grown-up children, I am very open to that and it could be some good RP.\n\nAm I werid? A little bit. Super nice though! Always looking for new friends to enjoy RP with.  \n\n{h3:c}{link*https://youtu.be/Gr5KdeKS7wc*Theme Music}{/h3}\n{/col}\n\n{h3}All things said, I do not seek out ERP. Romantic RP is fine with me and intimate RP can be part of it, but I do not soley look for ERP or ERP relationships, I need real story RP first!{/h3}\n\n",

The Sethrac sorcerer Harthiss bought him out of recognition for his intellect, and used him as a lab gopher for the most part...but Ambius watched everything his master did very carefully, secretly read every tome he could get ahold of, and soaked it all in.\n\nThe time came when he and Harthiss were visiting a Faithless trading camp to acquire supplies...a day on which it so happened several Horde adventurers tore through the area like an unstoppable tempest. When his master was slain, Ambius took his spell-book and coin purse, and fled with the other freed slaves for the Vulperan Hideaway.\n\nHe has since used the gold that was in the purse to pay for introductory lessons in magecraft, and now explores the worlds to acquire equipment, knowledge...and of course, more gold. Further, he found and joined a large Vulperan armada for mutual benefit, and serves as a researcher for their 'Keepers'.\n\nHis weapon was a gift from his primary teacher in Dalaran. It is a physical replica of the famed blade 'Felo'melorn', and has a name of its own; Felo'ligas...meaning. 'Flame Binder'. It has a few unique abilities that aid Ambius in keeping his magic under control.\n\nAmbius now carries a \"last resort\" artifact in a hinged box of pure truesilver. If the box is opened, everything and anyone within twenty feet containing mana and magical energy of the arcane or fel varieties will be nearly instantly drained of those resources. Either leaving that area, speaking the proper command word, or re-sealing the artifact in the box will allow a regeneration of energy at a rate of ten percent per minute. Magic cast into that area will also be absorbed by the artifact.\n",

The look of chaos swirling in and out, mirroring the chaos in her mind. \n\nStanding 5 ft tall the little elf was just a little bit too skinny, her dark skin was just a little bit washed out... but her color was starting to come back. Though the world had tried to defeat her by the looks of her... she had fought, and brought herself back to life. Her appearance was starting to reflect that as the days passed by. \n\nHer long hair was well kept, most of the time, and quite often worn in a braid. When she is not paying attention, or distracted by something she couldnt keep the resting bitch face look from creeping in. It was something she was actively working on, trying so hard to let her face show her emotions. As of late she wore the devious of smirks, as if she were up to something.\n\nHer demeanor seemed chaotic, even if she was sitting still she -had- to be doing something with her hands or run her mouth, rambling on and on about something that had little to do with anything. Anxiety was a curse, not that she didn't talk a lot to begin with. \n\nAithne was a hedonist, she enjoyed all the pleasures of life... from something as simple as smoking a joint in a quiet place, or giving in to those more carnal desires. All she wanted was to silence the never-ending ramble of her inner monologue left behind from the remnants of her past corruption.\n\nSo easily swayed by something that sparked the flames of excitement and pleasure, it didn't seem to matter what it was. She was an addict, plain and simple... and hated herself so much more for it.\n\nThe anxious voice inside her mind was constant, tormenting her every waking moment... lying to her, sparking the flames of her anxiety. \nConsciously she knew that not -everyone- was out to get her... but when the whispers broke out of their cage sometimes their lies were just too much. Aithne's sanity was hanging by the thinnest of threads, she could go two ways... full-blown insanity, or she could start to heal and learn to control herself. She was desperately trying for the latter. And very much succeeding.\n\nAithne is far more likely to start a fight than mind her own business, and her volatile ways brought her further chaos in its wake. \n\nFighting was something so much more than a way to express her anger. Sparring will always be where she feels she can best express herself, and like a favourite sport she was always happy to fight. Whether it's for fun, or in anger. She felt alive.\n\nShe enjoys others, and sometimes forms attachments to people she barely knows, just because they interest her and gave her the time of day. No matter how anxious others made her she was desperate to find and make new friends. She lets her energy level and mouth get the better of her, and has been known to talk a mile a minute about absolutely nothing if given the chance.\n\nNot your every day find||||\n\nDetermined, loyal to a fault, and fierce... Aithne is pure of heart and very street smart, though she has her moments of showing off her book smarts. She had been well educated, even if she had chosen a life without the use of books, and without the use of the education her family had forced upon her. \n\nThough she enjoys reading and learning she prefers to do it at her own pace, on her own time. she is a very capable learner and has taught herself most everything she knows in life and continues to use... the exception being the years of book-learning in her youth.\n\nLoyalties, Family ties||||\n\nHer only true connections currently are that of her older sisters, and her faithful companion Conri.\n\nThough she was technically the owner of Conri, the wolf took great pride in her job of protecting Aithne. Often times ignoring direct orders to protect her. Even when not by the Quel'dorei's side, the wolf was like a shadow.. prowling nearby, ready to come to Aithne's aid.\n\n~~~\n\nOOC Bits||||\n\nThis character is cross faction, you would not know just by looking at her. You would possibly know if your character is ALSO crossfaction and frequents Orgrimmar/Stormwind.\n\nAsk about art!\n\nI'm not that great at walking up, so if you see something then say hello. I'll appreciate you forever!\n\nAithne will give anyone the time of day, just say hello. \n21 + Only\nWalks up appreciated and loved, although I might not always respond so send a whisper if you dont get a response. I dont bite, promise.\n\n~~~\n\nHooks for those who want them||||\n\n- Has spent a great deal of time in the fighting pits, though her skin seems flawless. She's always up for a spar, and a chance to add to her winning streak.\n\n- Has been seen wandering Zandalar and each of the 3 zones for a few years longer than most Horde. She would have stood out enough to be noticed, ask her about it if your character noticed her!\n\n- Those of a more primal/animalistic nature will recognize a presence about her and her wolf, the presence much stronger when they are together but noticeable when they are apart.

During the Burning Crusade, he traveled to Outland but was more helping with provisional restocking than fighting.\n\nWhen the scourge rose, and the Lich King awoken, he used his compassion to assist those who lost their homes and loved ones. He traveled between the three horde capitals of Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, and Undercity giving aid and comfort to his fellow citizens. Uplifting their spirits with words of encouragement and giving what coin he could to help those that survived undeath, survive. \n\nWhen Deathwing came and tore the world asunder he still chose to heal, instead of take action. Not knowing what route to take in combat. The factions were at war again, and the world was changed forever when Deathwing came up from Deepholm. \n\nAfter the Destroyer was defeated, Fist was in Orgrimmar when a new faction joined the horde under neutrality. Ji Firepaw had a faction of Panderan with him and brought with him the teachings of the Monk. The way they used their bodies as a weapon instantly drew Fist to hear more. As a tauren, his large frame would make it a challenge but after standing on the sidelines for so long he knew it was time to take a stand and step on to the battlefield. But he would not ever be the aggressor. \n\nAfter the disposition of Garrosh, and the campaign on Draenor it almost seemed like peace would finally come to Azeroth. One threat comes after the other tho, and before long another group of visitors would come to Orgrimmar. Warchief Vol'jin welcomed these \"Demon Hunters\" and they spoke of another Burning Legion Invasion. It was only a matter of time before they would attempt to destroy our home again.\n\nWhen the call came out for volunteers to head to this island known as the \"Broken Shore\" to confront them at the Tomb of Sargeras, Fist signed up without hesitation. Protecting his home by extension was protecting those that lived there. All those who went to the shore know how that turned off. The loss of Vol'jin, and the passing of mantle to a new warchief - Sylvannas Windrunner. \n\nBy the time Fist came home from Argus, Fist was tired. The amount of fighting that had gone on from an endless army was extensive. But they had emerged victorious. It also showed him that the Horde and Alliance can throw aside their faction loyalties and unite under the banner of Azeroth to protect their home world.\n\nWhen Sylvannas decided to attack Teldrassil it made Fist question the Horde. Why should so many innocents die? It was an unprovoked attack. There was no reason for it. He questioned the motives of his Warchief. Where was she leading the Horde? They just got done fighting together, and now they are fighting each other. She brought both factions to the another war. So much death and loss on each side.\n\nWhen the veil was ripped open, her plan still didn't make sense to Fist. But he knew that she was acting on her own goals, not the great good of the Horde or Azeroth. Now that Fist has crossed over the Veil, he will still do what he can to protect those that he can and make sure that all those are treated fairly in his compay. He has never had a home to settle down in, so his travels will take him across the Shadowlands and make to Azeorth in time.",

Otherwise, she seems perfectly content to simply allow her skin to breathe.\n\nJelvii's body is adorned with all manner of well crafted jewellery and accessories. An exquisite ornamental filigree rests on her long shapely tail, encrusted with a polished amethyst.\n\nAmong the adornments are a set of wrist chains and a metal collar, both crafted with silver and designed to appear beautiful despite their purpose.

She is shameless about her enjoyment in her hobbies and pursuits. Due to her expensive tastes, Jelvii is dependent on others to maintain her lifestyle. Affluent and wealthy friends enabled her in Stormwind as she became increasingly incapable of taking care of herself. Any skills learned through hardship on Draenor were long forgotten. Outland was as distant a memory as her days as a young initiate in the priesthood. Though she has received formal training as a priestess of the Light, Jelvii denies any such power. She dislikes being recognised as one and will often speak negatively of her abilities and that part of her life.\n\nThe Fourth War and the loss of Teldrassil brought many hardships to the citizens of the Alliance. Jelvii saw many of her friends join the fight against the Horde. As a mere civilian, she simply remained in the safe protected walls of Stormwind hoping for life to go back to normal. Instead, she received letters from the front lines, news of death and tragedy, and worst of all found herself in a series of abusive relationships. Jelvii's expressive emotional personality and delicate constitution made her easy to use and abuse. And time after time, she found herself the subject of heartbreak.\n\nGrief was one emotion that proved far beyond the pleasure seeking ways that carried Jelvii from one day to the next. She couldn't run forever from relationships that ended poorly or from the reality that goodbye really meant goodbye. She had spent her nights partying with her best friends only to never see them again after they set sail for Kul Tiras. Daydreaming of her past relationships and the unhealthy idealisation that prevented her from seeing she was never truly loved. With every new understanding of how empty her life was, Jelvii began to sink further and further into a sense of defeat.\n\nNow, Jelvii finds herself wasting away in the streets of Stormwind no different from the displaced Darnassian refugees. With a dwindling supply of gold and an even shorter list of friends to pay for her most basic essentials, Jelvii wonders if she had survived the horrors of Outland simply to die starving in a city of wealth and opportunity. An ironic fate, she thought, but not one she wished to endure. The fear of death was now her motivation to simply try and improve her life, though she feared even more the notion that she knew nothing of the realities of caring for herself.",

Walk ups are greatly appreciated because of this.\n\n• If I'm marked as IC, I'm IC! This includes cities and the world, the only exceptions are dungeons and raids. I absolutely adore world RP so feel free to stop me while I'm questing or doing dailies! \n\n• On top of adoring world RP, I also live for cross faction interactions! Aman is neutral in terms of his attitude towards the Alliance, so feel free to walk up!\n\n• While I have over a decade of RP experience, I'm fairly new to WoW and its lore (I only started playing when BfA was released), so patience is appreciated! Feel free to correct me (nicely) if I say something that is not supported by lore. \n\n• Please note that the I'm autistic and a relatively slow typer (especially for longer replies), so patience is very much appreciated when it comes to responces! \n\n• That being said, I ever miss a responce, please don't be afraid to whisper me and let me know!\n\n• Thanks so much for reading this all, have a fantastic rest of your day or night!",

Various odds and ends stick out of it, a few being her simple blowgun, a once ornate spyglass heavily tarnished and dull, and her bedroll strapped to the top.\n\nIf one is lucky enough to observe her without being completely covered up (She lets down her hood occasionally!) one could see that her fur is of a pure white color. The small parts of her skin that arnt covered in fur are of a pink color.. when not sunburned that is. ",

Black Market Smuggler. Chaser of beauty and danger. Terrible cook.{/h3}\n\nYou probably have, of course, heard of the Novikov family if you spend a frequent amount of time in Dalran. When the family name is mentioned, it's always spoken about in hushed tones -- as if speaking it will manifest some sort of terrible fate upon the one who dares to say the name aloud. \n\nOn the surface, the Novikovs are a family of merchants who have a knack for savvy and entrepreneurial business dealings. Their ware of choice is, of course, smuggled artifacts intended for the Black Market. This is no secret. In fact, the Black Market in Dalaran is frequented by buyers almost as often as any other auction house in a major city. The huge economic boost and revenue makes the Kirin Tor turn a blind eye, and so business in the Underbelly continues on each day as normal. \n\nBut the politics of shady business dealings, especially among a family of rogues such as the Novikovs, isn't always pleasant. Many other smugglers aim for the same attention and preference that Madam Goya gives to the Novikovs.\n\nTry as their enemies may, nothing will stop the Novikov Family from keeping complete control over their trade empire. Nothing.\n\n{h3:c}Character Information{/h3} \n{h3}Black Market Smuggler{/h3}Vlahos thinks he's quite alluring due to his ability to charm his buyers into whatever business deal benefits him the most at the time. As a rogue, he's also skilled at getting out of precarious situations if the business deal goes south. He actually prefers not to get involved in combat or fighting, thinking that there isn't a conflict in the entire world that couldn't be solved with the right business deal, but he has no qualms about taking a life if the situation requires it.\n\n{h3}Internal Conflict {/h3}As Vlahos has gotten older, he has begun to wonder if the live of smuggling stolen artifacts, while glamorous and thrilling, is what he's meant to do in life. He sees the heroes and champions coming in and out of the city, heading off to fight their noble battles to save the world time and time again, and feels discontent growing inside his heart. This internal conflict only grows stronger with every new hero that he meets in the world...\n\n{h3}Chaser of Beauty and Power{/h3} Vlahos is attracted to everything that is beautiful and dangerous. Perhaps you'll catch his eye.\n\n\n{h3:c}OCC Information{/h3}\nPlayer is a 29 year old queer woman. I'm extremely new to RP and to WRA, but happy to be here! I enjoy creative writing, and I'm using RP to help with inspiration and to practice my creativity. \n\nLooking for more lighthearted, adventurous RP with smuggler/trade/Indiana Jones-esque plotlines. Not really looking for ~romantic~ plots at this time, unless they happen naturally as the story unfolds.\n\n{h3} Current  Relationships:{/h3}\nAlyosha Novikov - Older Brother\nArtem - Adventuring Companion\n\n\n",

They're typically the first thing noticed about a demon hunter. In Karcinogen's case, that's no different. They are immensely large and curve upwards gradually. The entire length though, have ridges and are as black as obsidian. Kept long and tied up in a traditional manner is the male's hair, raven hued and swept back for convience for the most part. Along the male's jaw is facial hair, which is just along his jawline but kept neat. Evenly trimmed, and maintained daily. Karcinogen's face is that of a normal Sin'dorei's, apart from the blindfold with the typical fel-green glow that most Illidari don. He's even managed to keep his face free of any scars.{col:7f5530} Ω{/col}\n\n{col:7f5530} Ω{/col} The famous tattoos can be found sprawling across his chest and back. These typically glow the same fel-green as his eyes, only pulsing with energy when in combat. Beneath the tattoos lie corded muscle from daily training and going on hunts often. Not only the muscles hide beneath the tattoos, but countless scars of many past battles and fights. As of recently, the Illidari's skin tone has darkened and taken on a bit of a scaly look. There's also the growth of talons of where he once had finger and toe-nails.{col:7f5530} Ω{/col}\n\n{col:7f5530} Ω{/col} It appears that Karcinogen has finally made an upgrade to his armor; after literally being forced to. That old armor just wouldn't stay on anymore. While still light and allows mobility, he's made quite a few improvements to the physical defense a suit of armor should provide. Fel magic and enchantments can be felt from a good distance away; while the armor still has a lot of gaps, the magic would likely make up for them. Oh, and the skull's blade on his belt?

While many of the race dip their claws into those questionable things at times there are outliers among them, this man being one. A sly deft hand combined with knowledge of the arcane arts is just as fearsome as a any hulking warrior.\n\n\nThis one however is not a brusier stomping around as if the world trembles beneath his tread. No heavy metal garbs him, merely somewhat ornate robes matched by an embroidered hood only slightly stained from long term use. From within that shadowy lee a pair of bright blue eyes gaze out relentlessly, humorously offset by the pair of scruffy, ragged looking ears that poke out from either side of his cowl.\n\n\nWhat little fur he has visible is of a bright red color, almost the tone of a blazing sunset. His fingertips however, are a dark almost black color blending in with his equally dark claws giving the impression that his nails are far longer than they should be. A flowing tail hangs behind him and with the way it moves one gets the distinct belief he has far more control over it that expected.\n\n\nA sturdy but well worn backpack hangs from his shoulders, stuffed with various things as one would expect.

They were her most illuminating feature: Arcane eyes, though compared to the verdant or azure lights of other elves, the glow was measured, curbed by a natural subtlety like shades of a falling sun. But these suns were still bright, defining high set cheeks that curved in tune with a full face, fuller brows that arched modestly and perked at their ends, centred with a nose of ample measure and well-cut shape. To best sum up Erissia’s appearance, words such as: inviting, moderate and serene were apt - pinched by patrician finesse in some spots, yet as strong and broad as a warrior should look in others. There was both warmth and calm, yet it'd be difficult to deny a fiery potential that seemed to surge below her surface, ready to bubble into honed annoyance if the situation required it.\n\nAccenting these refined facial features was a luscious flow of tidy hair, cascading with the smoothness of silk and sun-kissed to a satin red-orange. It was long too, passing just below her shoulders to scatter between defined back muscles or a flowing cloak of pelt and royal cloth, though bound up in rings of gold or spindles of colourful fabric, the mane usually sat higher, either with intricate braiding to placate the regal requirements of her official business, or held more loosely in tails for comfort and fun-going.\n\nTo follow her physique down any further than that may have proven a challenge for any tauren: She was short, especially for an Elf, barely peeking above five foot four - almost petite, one might've said, yet the toned muscle apparent below even the most baggy attire contributed to an all together leaner whole. This shapely stature was only accentuated by her outfits, usually stretched taut around her curves and ridges and more often than not studded with the well tempered plate of Elven smiths, warding her form from piercing strikes. The style thus predominantly consisted of two halves, one rugged -to face the harshest colds via fur skins and cloaks or to diffuse crisp heat with partings and thinner cloth- And the other finely crafted, interwoven silks and velvets padding the insides to leave a softer touch on the skin -no doubt comfortable- as well as pelts and hides; conforming to create a tastefully sophisticated aesthetic. Notably constant among the shifting styles was an elegant set of golden jewelry that was always worn, one piece leafed and woven into a brace that always sat snugly upon her pale right bicep alongside a carved necklace embedded with an ovular emerald that rested atop her collar. Finally, two swords -One short, for parrying, and one long- filled the role of armament, both ornately decorated with swirls of gilded filigree and enchanted scripture atop Damascus blades, curved for slashing deep and severing flesh from flesh.\n \nErissia's strong poise was hardly just limited to the physical aspect of her body and attuned appearance though, for her form -even the way she strode- was like that of a dancer: Practiced, purposeful and brimming with a subtle confidence. A warrior, especially one of the Blood would've picked out the tell-tale signs of martial training in her deliberate movements, as well as signs of refinement that'd only originate through experience, yet equally it’d be hard to miss that her combative posture could all but fade with comfort, just as her usually blunt and matter-of-fact mannerisms faded to warmer smiles and gleeful giggles in turn. The dichotomy there might've even appeared jarring to a socialite; What was seemingly a facade used to facilitate her employ or deal with distasteful company was distant and brutal, like some jagged peak sprouting from the horizon, as it held a ploy-calm designed to aggravate and intimidate. And as a polar opposite to this was a near over-expressive joy that was cherished too dearly, as if she were starved and might perish without embracing the current moment.\n\nFeelings of deep happiness were a strong passion, burning delighted intensity within her soul, but there was no Mana fueled energy to accompany it; No pulse of etheric blue hues that'd indicate a runic use, and on second glance, her golden yellow eyes were dim, the magic that formed them now practically absent. Compared to any other elf her arcane aura was shallow and latent, seemingly at the periphery of the Sunwell's revitalizing touch which provided just enough of the Sin'dorei's lifeblood to sustain her health. Thus much like the cosmic background, there was only the humming of a nigh-undetectable tune. Erissia was a nebula outshone by the surrounding stars, only reflecting their light and producing none of her own. To many seers: An enigma.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{p:c}{col:ffff00}†==========================================================†{/col}{/p}\n",

She is an affectionate, friendly bear, and expressive physically with her emotions. But most of all, she is a loyal companion to those she allows to get close.\n\nAs a Pandaren, she stands a little above average height for her kind, roughly 6’5 with a generous thicc, curvaceous frame. Her shoulders are broad with a lovely bosom with a depth of cleavage that an Orc could bury their face in; her waist is a little narrow and her stomach slightly toned under a layer of velvety violet-black and silver-toned fur. Much of her weight is carried in the girth of her wide hips and a large, supple and succulent rump that is much admired.  \n\nCurious by nature, her attention span can be short, as she’s often distracted by the newest shiny object or person that catches her eye. Though, she can still be attentive of her surroundings, due to her former training as a Hunter; her ears are sensitive to the sounds of the most subtlest motions, allowing her to detect most forms of stealth, which she quickly picks up on — an ability Remy does not reveal often, as it makes her an excellent tracker.\n\nRemy once served as a faithful Sidekick to any Hero she chose to follow, and was likely to embellish any story about you, just to see how far she can push the punchline of her terrible punny jokes. Her time in the Horde has seen a shift in the balance of her once innocent point of views, the rose-colored glasses ripped away and now a bone mask is donned as she adopted the orcish ways of her new family among the Laughing Skull Orcs that she is allied to. Becoming slightly more cutthroat and off-kilter with the passing of each new moon. Pain is laughter. Pain is strength. \n\nShe has shifted away from her former life as a Huntsman to expand her bag of tricks and take on a new role, trained in the ways of the Shadowblade; no longer the cute sidekick and become more vigilant and rogue-ish in her new endeavors to find her place in the world. Bows and arrows exchanged for blades and axes. A mask donned to help her hide in the shadows. \n{/p}",

Recent events have killed her ability to connect with people.\n   -Very Dramatic about a lot of things, can sometimes be seen sitting in strange places or lying on tables, lamenting her life, sitting in chairs wrong, complaining about herself, or just being ridiculous. \n   -She tends to act way older than she is, this may be from hearing how old 7,245 is to a lot of people, worming the idea into her head that she's some old woman.\n   -She is often depressed, but is working towards bettering herself.\n\n++Voice: Stock draenei player character voice, but a tad deeper, Naturally, a light \"rUsSiAn\" accent.\n\n++Born on the Genedar to two very dedicated practioners of the Light, was believed by her parents to be a prodigy in service of the Light.\n\n++Family;\n   -Mother; Isaara, a War Priest.\n   -Father; Vizor, a Paladin and Justicar.\n   -Sister; Iyona, nothing in particualr, but Lonara thought very highly of her.\n\n++Quickly became a capable squire, spent her time either training, hyping her sister Iyona like it's her career, or dragging her on adventures.\n\n++IT happened and things got bad. Her parents dedicated their time to protecting them and the others as the fled across the Draenor. Lonara made it her duty to protect and look after Iyona, and keep her spirts up.\n\n++Exodar was taken, Lonara and Iyona got on board, parents stayed behind with a few others to keep their attention, both presumed dead.\n\n++Sabotage! Lonara and Iyona got seperated in the chaos, Lonara landed in her pod, rushed to the crash site, found a grave plot for Iyona, her body was never found.\n\n++BIG SADS, WUH OH. Lonara got super depressed, tried to jump into the big whole in the Exodar's center attrium. Was the seat of a Naaru, O'ros saved her and she got taken to the medical ward.\n\n++Draenei haul ass over Outland and Illidan got booped, Lonara snaps out of it in time for the Sunwell Shenanigans, trains up and enlists in the Offensive. Leads her fellow Shattered Sun to victory, feels pride and joy for a the first time in a long time!\n\n++ZOMBIES! Lich King causes a ruccus and she goes North to North... Rend and starts beating the Scourge like it's her job! (Cause it is) Joins the Argent Crusade, and meets a Troll by the name of Sui'jen, becomes friends and they fight together against the hells of Northrend.\n\n++Arthas gets his bussy beat, and everyone goes home, except for Lonara who goes home with Sui'jen, they're in lesbians with eachother now. Spend time with her family, good friends with her mother, not so much the rest.\n\n++Big asshole Dragon jacks everything up and Lonara spends most of the Cataclysm joining Sui'jin in her travels to help where they can, doing their best to stay out of the Faction beefing. Finding a nice remote place in Stone Talon to call home.\n\n++Married! How cute! Got a shaman to give them the blessing of the spirits and everything! Enjoys a calm life with her troll wife and didn't give two shits about whatever nonsense happend in the Panda lands...

					["TX"] = "Crug was born in the year 18 to his parents inside Durnholde Keep, an internment camp. Later that year Thrall liberated the Orcs from Durnholde, and escaped with them to Kalimdor. At some point between Crugs birth and the Orcs arrival on Kalimdor, both of Crugs parents died. It was later in the year 21 when the Orcs settled into Orgrimmar, and at that time, Crug was only 3 years old. Since Crug had no family, he was placed in the Orgrimmar Orphanage and raised by Orphan Matron Battlewail and Tosamina. Crug looked up to Thrall because he liberated his people from the internment camps, and because of his leadership as warchief of the Horde. Crug always  admired how Thrall could see the strength of other races. Growing up in Orgrimmar had been a positive experience for Crug because over the years he had observed many great warriors of the Horde, and while many of them were orcs like himself, there were also Tauren and Trolls that he admired.\n\nCrug turned 6 years old in the year 24. Crug began weapons training at this age, and it became clear that Crug would follow the path of a Protection Warrior.  Protection warriors are stout, dauntless defenders. Using a sturdy shield both to soak up foes' attacks and to dish out damage of their own, Protection warriors can take an immense amount of damage, able to withstand the most powerful of blows. Taunting and demoralizing their enemies with a range of shouts and devastating attacks, Protection warriors are formidable tanks, leading their allies to victory against the mightiest of adversaries. Six years later in the year 30, Crug had finally completed his warrior training, and was ready for his Om'riggor. An Om’riggor is a rite of passage in orcish society. Om'riggor is practiced amongst all orc clans, and both male and female orcs enter adulthood through om'riggor.The rite of om'riggor becomes available no earlier than age 12. Initiates are permitted only to bring a single weapon with no armor or provisions. If the initiate is successful in the solo kill, he/she will paint the blood of the prey upon his/her face as proof. Upon the initiate's return a clan shaman will taste the blood, and if deemed genuine, the initiate will be inducted into adulthood through a formal ceremony.\n\nArmed with an axe, and wearing nothing but a single piece of loin cloth covering his privates, Crug set off into the desert of Durotar to earn his solo kill. After many days, and nights of living off the harsh desert lands, Crug found a beast worthy enough to test if he was truly ready to fight for the Horde. A Bloodtalon Tailslasher had locked eyes with Crug from across the valley….seconds after their eyes met, the Tailslasher starting charging at Crug. Crug let out  a loud battle cry, and charged in the Tailslashers direction. Suddenly Crug leaped forward in the air, with his axe raised above head, he came crashing down on the Tailslasher, his axe impaled in its skull.. Blood was squirting out of the Tailslashers head, pouring out onto Crugs face. Crug paused, and released his solo kill, letting the blood of the Tailslasher completely cover his face. Crug cut the Tailslasher up, and ate just enough of the body to give him the strength to journey back to Orgrimmar.\n\nUpon Crugs return to Orgrimmar a shaman tasted the blood upon Crugs face, and deemed him ready to fight for the Horde, shortly thereafter Crug was shipped to Pandaria to aid the Horde forces.\n\nAs the campagine in Pandaria raged on, Crug observed Garrosh’s mistreatment of the other races within the Horde, and lost even more respect for Garrosh than he already had as Crug saw the bombing of theramore as dishonorable. Crug would eventually join the dark spear rebellion and help overthrow Garrosh as  Warchief.\n\nIn the year 31 Crug was reassigned from the Horde front lines, to guard Orgrimmar, and Durotar.\n\nIn the year 32 Crug was reassigned from guarding Orgrimmar and Durotar back to the Horde frontlines to serve in the war against the Legion during their third invasion. Crug served cautiously under the new warchief Sylvanas, as he found her use of the plague dishonorable.\n\nIn the year 33 Crug served in the fourth war while disapproving of his warchief Sylvanas for her dishonorable tactics in war, specifically during the Battle for Lorderon, this along with many other misdeeds by the warchief caused Crug to join Varrok Saurfangs Rebellion. Which led to the establishment of a Horde Council represented by the faction leaders. Crug likes that the power of warchief is split up, and respects all members of the council....he does think that they are too accepting of the Alliance.\n\nIn the year 34 Crug was reassigned from the Horde front lines, to guard Orgrimmar, and Durotar once again.\n\n\n\n",

Olive green skin and an unmistakable accent that often spews a handful of improvised curses assures any observers of that much.\n\nSlax stands about as squat as most of her kin, though she's perhaps an inch or two taller than the norm; nothing that'd particularly make her stand out. She does, however, deviate a bit in terms of physique. It's evident that she's comfortable with whatever it is her present lifestyle entails. It appears she's fattened either due to or in spite of it, sporting thick legs, doughy arms and a plump, muffin-topped midriff. \n\nTaking countenance into consideration, Slax's features could be considered modest while maintaining substantial distance from being deemed unattractive. A pair of platinum eyes displayed a muted luster that complemented the bedazzling ornaments she wore quite well. One small emerald stud pierced her right nostril while a duo of more miniscule prismatic gems gently twinkled on the opposite end. With regards to earrings, it appeared she doubled up on both ends. Two silver hoops dangled from each, matching the tone of the chain that spanned the circumference of her neck.\n\n[...]\n{/p}\n{/col}\n\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:B5EEFF}H O O K S {/h3}\n{col:ceffe9}—Spent some time in a Steamwheedle-owned outpost? Slax frequents Ratchet and has made jumps around to connected settlements. Must've done something semi-important for the Cartel at some point or another.\n\n—Care for Kaja'Cola? This goblin's got a can or three clutched nearby more often than not. She might share, she might not.\n\n—Anyone who has passed through Undermine in the past might recognize Slax as the prior receptionist for the local mechpriests' firm, a position she held for a year or three.\n\n—Rumors of a hole-in-the-wall jewelry startup have begun to pop up around Ratchet with Slax's name tied to its ownership. Hmm.\n\n—Similarly, posters offering the contact information of \"repossession services for hire\" can be tied to Slax's likeness in a few Horde settlements.\n\n\n",

Though while this does describe him, within almost every sense, it would be within most people’s best interest not to call him that given that he would find this to be almost a down right insult.  Even though in most cases he would be applying a heavy amount of makeup while insulting you!\n\nThe best start would be his face; Short hair that hugged his face and was so well maintained it would look as if he combed it and maintained it whenever he woke up.  Messing with it would most likely cause a fuss with this short tempered one.  His soft cheeks were soft and whatever jawline that could be seen was covered with a creamy foundation that accented the dark hair quite well, least he thought so!  His eyes, goodness those eyes, well his eyes were just average alright?  They glowed green and he wished they were better.  Though his cute nose, small and button, how he hated it.  He was constantly teased while growing up.  Though his favorite feature, which he always painted with an array of colors that would match the season!  His lips.  His lips were puffy and stuck out quite well, they were his best feature, least on his face they were.  He felt it was something that many should be jealous of and if it wasn’t weird he would talk about his lips at parties, though, sadly it was weird to talk about your lips at parties.\n\nHis body though was something to, well, his body was sleek and almost willowy.  Almost having no muscle mass at all.  Most likely this could be a reason for his falling all the time as most of the mass of his body is at the lower end!  His hands and most of his upper body would highlight more of that effeminate nature that was so spoken about.  Soft skin always.  No calluses on these hands.  Also a scent that also, like his lips, always matched the season!  His upper body would also be adorning the latest fashion.  Though all that was on the crux is; Can I afford all this?  And sometimes a mage on such a budget must sadly make cuts for beauty!  \n\nThough what -most- considered his best accent was his lower features.  He did not see it that way as you cannot design around it.  It also cost him more at the tailor shop to get the latest fashion too!  Though his hips were wide, quite wide in fact that would make him look like, well, like a certain fruit.  His rear though he would do his best to hide it between dresses, skirts, whatever he could!  It stuck out far too much for him to consider it ‘good’ though he did all in his power to hide it.  Though sadly he isn’t the best mage, actually, he’s an awful mage.  So hiding his large rear is out of the magical question.  \n\nThen there are his feet.  They are there.\n\nOne day he will become a better mage.  Though for now he’s still a student and one that spends more time thinking of being a great mage than trying to be one!  He just hasn’t realized that isn’t how you become a great mage yet...",

With both her younger sisters lost to her in different ways, Rynhel throws herself into the campaign to kill the Lich King, working closely with her former commander once again.\n\nAfter the fall of the Lich King, Rynhel felt an emptiness overtake her, unsure of her purpose she wandered the world, fighting aimlessly for anyone who needed her bow.

Among the chaos he was knowingly abandoned by his mother who fled with her other children. The slavers then abducted Borrev and initiated him to servitude. He was fortunate enough to be ignorant of lifes simple pleasure's for some time. Borrev was obedient in his childhood years, but when the Faithless began requiring him to do much more work able for adults he began to defy them. Now left with a branding on his left wrist as a form of punishment, he resigned to his fate and lived a hollow life until Nisha and the rest of the Vulperans broke out. When his cage was open, he had to be provoked to leave.\n\nWhen he finally was accustomed to being free, an overwhelming sense of joy swept him. At first he joined whatever caravans would take him in Vol'dun, searching for treasure and sneaking around in the desert. This was the beginning of the skills he started learning he instinctively has. While not as adept in fighting as he is in trickery and stealth, he isn't afraid to use any advantage or dirty trick to survive.",

She heard the stories of how he betrayed his people but she didn't understand all of the hate. He had blessed them with eternal life with the waters of the Well of Eternity and helped them start anew. She had a soft spot in her heart for him, and secretly studied the arcane art as he did although it was outlawed in their society. She grew up knowing relative peace until the third war in which she heard of the Illidan's release. She fled her home and chased him down, finally escaping to Outland and joining him at the Black Temple. She pledged her loyalty to him and devoted herself to his cause: the destruction of The Burning Legion. She trained to be one of the first Illidari, Illidan's trusted army of demon hunters. She trained hard, sacrificed everything, and grew to be one of Illidan's trusted soldiers. She was frequently sent on his most important scouting missions and proudly stood by him when the forces of Azeroth stormed the Black Temple and tried to kill her master. She fought her loved ones, but was eventually imprisoned by the wardens until she was later released to fight The Legion with the Alliance on the Broken Isles. She now fights alongside them, but they know that her true loyalty will always lay with Illidan.  {/col}\n\n{h1}Personality and Appearance{/h1}\n\n{col:27dc24}Ahlaria was taller than most of her race, slender, and agile, but with muscle tone to indicate that she was a fighter. Her horns and the sickly red glow of the fel in her tattoos made it easy to tell that she was a demon hunter. She was old, especially compared to human standards, but she had a youthful, if somewhat intense look to her. Though elegant, scars dot her form to show that she has seen many battles, before her unjust imprisonment for a great many years. Ahlaria would always be seen in her Illidari regalia, which was obviously kept in fine condition, for she wanted to represent her faction with dignity. Depending on her mood she could be timid and afraid to reach out, and other times she could be completely stand offish, keeping to herself in the distrust of others due to the slaughter of her people at the Black Temple. Once approached, however, there was little that would keep would-be companions at bay, for she often smelled of flowers, and cared openly for a certain cat that was often at her side.

They are now an inky black, with barely any reflection when you look into them.\n\nThe tattoos and her eyes are emphasized in their darkness by the very pale blue tint to her skin, which is varied in places due to scarring and exposure to sunlight over her years in the field.\n\nGavriyal’s hair has now become a similar inky, raven black as her eyes are. She has not yet gotten around getting it cut again, so she has taken to braiding it in order to keep it out of her face. It’s reached her shoulders in length.\n\nHer frame is muscular, tall--seven feet, two inches. More in boots.--and lean. She has become far more lean in recent times.

						["TX"] = "Born in southern Darkshore to parents Vache and Siraya At'Lané, a warrior and a priestess, Gavrie began to explore the wilds of Darkshore and Ashenvale at an early age. As she grew it quickly became clear that she would not be likely to follow in either of her parents’ footsteps. The tenth time little Gavriyal presented Siraya and Vache with a creature and implored ‘Can I keep it?’ her path became clear.\n\nHer training as a hunter was difficut at times, especially at first. Despite her obvious affinity and skill with the beasts and creatures she tamed, archery took her far more time to master. More than once neighbors would find stray arrows in their backyard foliage. Tenacious and determined, Gavriyal practiced until she could put any fully trained Sentinel to shame.\n\nIn her adolescence and early adulthood, Gavriyal trained and served with the Sentinels. She traveled from Ashenvale all the way to Feralas and back as she matured and mastered her skills. When the call to Outland came out, she stayed behind to guard Kalimdor while others fought to eliminate the immediate threat of the Legion. Truthfully she had wanted to join the assault, but the safety of their homeland was equally important. She was no hero, and such adventures were for the heroic types.\n\nThe Sunwell cleansed, Illidan, Kael'thas AND Kil'jaeden slain… Gavriyal celebrated with her kin and comrades for their victory. The celebration was just a tad bittersweet. The young Sentinel longed to see those front lines. \n\nWhen the threat of the Scourge once again reared its foul head and the call to arms for Northrend rang out, this time Gavrie was among those who joined the fight. Determined to help wipe Arthas from the face of Azeroth, she crusaded against his forces and shared in many victories as well as setbacks–one setback being her encounter with the risen Death Knight which had once been her older brother, Alenras.\n\nTheir encounter was not a pleasant one. It ended with Gav destroying the artifact Alenras was pursuing, and this angered him greatly. Gavriyal was left with a souvenir of the fight: a crescent shaped scar that followed the arch of her brow and cheekbone, exposing the bones beneath the flesh. She had sustained other injuries as well, but that one is the only scar that she still carries to the present day.\n\nWhen Arthas was felled, victory was felt throughout the world. Finally the Scourge were not quite the menace they had once been, finally those who had lost loved ones to his rule could feel peace.\n\nThe consolation prize of the encounter with her brother was the making of a new friend: Valdyrr Marric. A Gilnean druid who had worked for days to be sure the scourged wound was healed and the infection did not reach Gavriyal’s brain. While he was unable to improve the cosmetic look to the scar, Gavrie found herself in his debt. A debt that would form quite a strong friendship as it was repaid.\n\nFor awhile, there was peace and normalcy. But as many would say, 'normal’ for Azeroth hardly ever means that there is no threat to life as its citizens know it. Deathwing’s escape and attack left Gavrie’s home country of Darkshore broken to pieces, the elements raging over its forests. After returning home to help with damage control, she again marched into the fray. Deepholm, Hyjal, Uldum and even the Firelands themselves did not escape her wrath. The Earth Warder and his many minions were taken down piece by piece until Gavrie and her comrades of the time were quite literally tearing Deathwing apart.\n\nWith the Aspect of Death defeated, Gavrie returned to Kalimdor once more to continue aiding in the rebuild in territories like her homeland of Darkshore and those drastically changed by the cataclysm such as Feralas and Thousand Needles. So much needed to be done to repair their broken world.\n\nIn the midst of licking their wounds, the mists of the South Seas parted and a new land  was revealed and its secrets were ripe for discovery. The once placid Sentinel now fancied herself something of a hero and adventurer, and thus, Gavriyal could not resist the call of Pandaria.\n\nWith the Sha and Garrosh Hellscream defeated, Gavrie and Valdyrr were hardly given any breathing room before Hellscream escaped and began the shenanigans to form the Iron Horde.\n\nDraenor proved a challenge for them. Neither had experienced Outland when the Legion had first reared its head to threaten Azeroth, and experiencing what it had been before Sargeras had mangled it was an exciting time, even without the point of reference. The wilds of Draenor were vast and strange. The Iron Horde’s armies were felled, driven into the bowels of Hellfire Citadel. Archimonde was defeated, and Gul’dan driven from Draenor. Once again, it was time to recuperate and rebuild.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nFirst word of the Broken Isles being compromised, and then a call to arms. The Legion had finally brought the fight to Azeroth itself. Demon Hunters were free once more, and demons now attacked their very strongholds and lands. \n\nGavriyal and Valdyrr were among those who answered the call to the Broken Shore. Ready and willing to kill as many demons as was needed to keep their home safe. But… they were not quite prepared. \n\nWith the birth of her daughter, Estel, Gavriyal has been taking some time to recover at home and help to care for her. But soon it will be to the battlefront, again.\n\nHere we go again.",

The moment he turned 15 he enlisted on his first vessel lying about his age to sucure the position, he's been on the sea ever since, bouncing around from port to port, never setting any roots.\n\nKrenn has done many things in his sailor career, he's done ferry passage, mercenary ships, importing, exporting anything you can think of. He's probably done it....short of military service. His only regret in life is not being able to help out the rebuilding of Silvermoon when Arthas attacked, because his vessel was at the time off the coast of Westfall heading to Booty Bay to deliever teas from up north. \n\nHe now commands a vessel named \"The Silver Phoenix\"\n\nKrenn spends most of his time nowadays hitting the bars at ports while his crew secures cargo to transport, trying to make friends and connections for things later in life. Maybe one day he'll settle down, only time will tell.{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QuestionFrame\\answer-warfronts-horde-CallOfTheStorm:2556:1}\n\n{h1:c}OOC Info{/h1}\n\nI ignore everyone in the Guilds Champion of the Lion, and Gearpunk Dynamics, and Firebrand Trust.\n\nPlayer is 25+ Male, I have Aspberger's Syndrome so please, please, please be patient with me,",

He stood at a startling 6 feet tall with a few inches to boost and barely peeked under 190’ lbs. His skin tone, being a dark brown in the night but smooth chocolate brown in the day, gets him spotted rather quickly as the son of Dalarans famous retired Warmage,Lady Archmage Briana Cain.\n\nWith his wondrous height however came his stature and physique, being well muscled and rather “chiseled” due to duel  training to be a Argent Paladin and his more tribal orcish training with his  Stepfather Krurg Fullguard.\n\nIf anyone took their eyes from his top it would only leave him a bit embarrassed and begin to shy away from, as even humans can come \"blessed\" said by his step-father when Maurice began to reach points of maturity he still yet to finish growing from and one of the many reason he wears a compressed under armor and robe like armor and clothing.\n{/col}{/p}\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_artifact_tome01:25}{/h1}\n{p:c}{col:ffe297}With an inquisitive nature and docile attitude Maurice is an all around optimistic realist despite being a behemoth fighter and skillful warrior with a variety of weapons training, preferring to use his mind and brains to solve situations otherwise seen as impossible rather than doing it the easy way and fighting his way out of it.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h1:c}{icon:inv_alchemy_lightbloodelixir:25}{/h1}\n{p:c}{col:ff150d}My curse and my strength\nBorn of bad blood, \nBut raised with the faith and hope\nThat I could do better\nBe better.{/col} {/p}\n{p:c}{col:ffe297}Coming to terms with his original fathers rather evil bloodline as a necromancer Maur has decided to push his natural ability to use Hemomancy a bit further as to ensure the curse passed down from his ancestors stops and ends with him.

Sabotaging wagons, stealing and smuggling supplies over city lines, and killing others before they can kill you are just some of the skills needed to survive in this group. Of course there was strength in numbers, and they took advantage of that, targeting weaker wagons and raiding and pillaging them, taking their food and supplies and taking no one alive. This lifestyle led to many other caravans seeking to destroy and capitalize on their business, leading to the one fateful day that a certain rival group managed to sneak into Rikki's group's and murder nearly the entire caravan. Although managing to survive, Rikki did lose his left eye, and, along with the very few other surviviors of the attack, decided to stow away on a ship to Kalimdor, specifically Orgrimmar.

She would have perished easily if not for the efforts of a single baffled Vulpera who happened upon her. Time passed, and the two grew close, living together for several years and even having a child, but the differences kept both of them from interacting with either of their people, not that they cared too much. They had each other...until one day, the woman vanished, leaving behind her husband and son, though not without leaving her mark...due to what she was.\n\nThis, was the story of Areku's parents.\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/2xuWDjh.png*Some Art of Areku, by RaptorChap}\n{link*https://d.furaffinity.net/art/foxyareku/1612221702/1612221615.foxyareku_kahawte.png*Art of Areku and Kahawte, by Moose}\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/NDD36cP.png*Demon Areku, by Enkie}\n\n\n{h1}Meta Knowledge{/h1}\n\nAreku is a half-demon, related to Sayaad's, or Succubi. He may have an effect on your character, much like a pheromone that increases attraction, while at the same time making those around him feel more relaxed and less stressed or anxious. You can choose to respond to this, or not. He does suppress it to the best of his ability, but it leaks out quite commonly. \n\nDemon Hunters and those who simply aren't attracted to men (or even vulpera) would be immune to this effect, Demon Hunters also would have the ability to tell what he is in a heartbeat, but otherwise unless your character is incredibly familiar with demons and how they work, they shouldn't be able to see anything but a standard Vulpera who feels a bit too hot.\n\nWhich speaking of, his body would also feel incredibly warm to the touch, not uncomfortably so, but still unnaturally warmer than your average person.\n\nIf you read this thank you, I LOVE when people act on this part of Areku in RP, so if you want to go into how this may have effected your character, please do!\nAlso he has a reason for having a last name.\n\n(Please stop making us vulpera rpers look bad!)\n",

Wide hips further than her shoulders, a wiggling wobbling rump stuffed into whatever outfit she deems fashionable that day, and a real pair of gonhonagazooks leading her where she walks, threatening to pop out of a cleavage window you could lose an arm in, all of this seperated by tiny bit of pudge in a thick waist.\n\nEqually plush looking thighs taper down to her feet, often wrapped in the tightest of knee-height designer boots, carrying the beauty from place to place in style.\n\nRarely far from a cosmically conjured milkshake or beverage.\n\n\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/vz4NbEh.png*Ain't I just a looka~'?} Art by OhDangDoof\n{link*https://i.imgur.com/4J08Lyq.png*We're both pretty fantastic~} Art by Jazziks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince i'm plugging my friends, maybe I should also just go ahead and plug my own stuff too~ \n\nBe warned, this stuff is SUPER extreme and NSFW.\n{link*https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/brownhair798/*My Gallery of big screenshot manipulations}\nI do requests, but only if I -really- like the idea and the look.\n\nCurrent size: {link*https://i.imgur.com/nPZbj0f.png*Bigger.}",

The soft, white fur contained by a set of leathers they've come to claim as their own after formerly sticking to trainee gear; Seems the pandaren's found himself beyond that now.\nHowever, one would take notice the same stature of some pandaren women, a delicate looking, curvy, feminine figure, giving a rather androgynous appearance still.\n\nTo further compliment his feminine body and structure, this particular pandaren chose to wear things such as human makeups. Their eyes had a bit of shadow to them, and it wouldn't be surprising to find their lips were a rather deep, oceanic blue such as their soft eyes.\nEyeing down their form one could find wide, flared hips fitting for a 'woman' like himself, though that was to be debated. This was complimented by the plush and fuzzy thighs he had as well, perfect for a headrest if they convinced him. Around the back rested their well rounded, plush bottom that wiggled to his steps, often causing him some sheepish moments at how pronounced it was.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMagical Brewing\n\nYin has been learning from another pandaren going by the name Mei Windpaw who is teaching him the art of magical brewing, starting with some basics in transformative types.\n\nWARNING: New potions may be slightly unstable or have lasting effects, he is still experimenting and learning.\n\n\n\n\n/c/\n",

Soon a slaver noticed her talent with magic and bought her in order to be trained. as for why, that remains a mystery to her. maybe she thought she would one day be used as some weapon for the Sethraks. Either way, it would not change her fate. Aritzza would spend the next few years working with other slaves during the day and being forced to stay awake during the night to learn magic, getting little (if any) sleep in the process. She'd considered attempting to escape, but after witnessing what happened to those who were caught she decided to stay and endure her treatment, hoping that one day she would be free. That hope finally came to reality one day when a group of slaves escaped their holding cells and decided to go back for her. Thankfully it was during what little time she had to sleep.

Her body full of scars and battle wounds from the wars and battles shes endured. Although she is quite old her face is youthful and soft. Her eyes are bright and full of wonder, as if the years of turmoil and loss has not affected her at all. Her nose is small, and her horns are turned back, her short white hair only visable when she removes her helmet.Hellig was a walking conundrom, as she was hard, stubborn, strong willed and mature, as well as easy going, free thinking, open minded, loving, and carefree. Her years of heartache, loss, and war has shaped her but she still remained innocent, caring, and happy go lucky. She loves making new friends and learning other peoples stories, she's traveled the world of Azeroth learning history, and the story of as many people as she could. Highly intelligent and curious, she is full of questions and wonder for the world.\n\nHistory\n\nBorn on Argus, she lived in Mac'aree alongside Velen and his brothers, she escaped with Velen from Argus and also Draenor, she has lost her family long ago on Argus. Fearing she would have to escape yet again Hellig has yet to make a family for fear she may lose them. Battleworn, Hellig has fought for and by Velen's side from the beginning. Through her dedication to Velen and to her people, and her courage, she was gifted by the naaru  the ability to use the light, which is when she became a paladin. Her history is long, and her life is complicated, but maybe she has a few stories to share.\n\n\nCovenant \n\nWhen landing in the shadowlands Helligstraff was heartbroken when she learned of the betryal that fell upon the Venthyr although she finds their way crass at times, Helligstraff vowed to help the Venthyr redeem theirselves with their own people and to the other covens, although she is sometimes looked down upon by her fellow light weilders for allying with them, she feels that the light and the justice she can bring is needed where she is.\n",

Sparkly green eyes, pointy button nose, plump red lips, and a short silky raven mane that usually cascades down her shoulders or is held up in a bun. Yet, none of these characteristics seem to grab people's attention as much as her very obvious lack of left ear does. The empty spot on the side of her face also sports three small slash scars that can be seen running from her cheekbone and until hidden by her hair. Rys does not seem to like talking about how she lost her ear. The elf doesn't seem to carry herself around with much confidence, always looks tense, shoulders a little raised and head down as if trying to avoid eye contact, but whoever gets to see her standing up properly might catch that she's not as tiny as she usually looks. Her body has a certain strength to it.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:00e5ff}Personality{/col}{/h2}\n{col:d25eff}Ryswell Bellator is an unusual case for the family. Her older sisters show charisma and confidence to some extent, but the youngest Bellator seems to be devoid of these traits. Ryswell is a quiet presence, she speaks softly, to the point where it can be rather hard to hear her, and she usually tries to rush conversation, as if she were trying to get out of it. However, the young woman has a strong thirst for knowledge, and any chatter about the arcana will catch her interest and bring her out of her shell a little. Although quiet and shy, she can show incredible friendliness, she's loyal to the bone and is remarkably kind to those who manage to break down her walls. Some of her behaviors might hint that there's something stronger about her stirring under the surface, ambition and drive that sometimes come to light, but immediately get shut down as if they'd never been there. {/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:00e5ff}Background{/col}{/h2}\n\nOOC notes:\n- Congrats on making it all the way down here!

She's particularly looking for a teacher to help her with her training as a mage. The girl knows a fair bit of cryomancy and is interested in the area of illusion too, but I'm open to other schools of magic too!\n\n\n\n\n",

Her diminutive form lends to the slight sheepishness she often seems to hold, as if bracing for something. Still, when around friends or those she’s comfortable with, she tends to be significantly more relaxed. When unengaged, her face is often impassive and her dim eyes observant. In conversations, she’s quick to smile, her eyes often growing noticeably brighter.\n\n     Her skin is a peach close to pink, a touch lighter than most Sin’dorei. While her skin is mostly without scars or blemishes, an observant eye would notice an array of faint scars across her right hand reminiscent of broken glass. However, it’s far from uncommon for her to sustain some sort of injury, whether it be obtained through her work as a freelancer, her own reckless behavior, or some combination of the two. She often keeps her long carrot-colored hair in either a ponytail or a braid, but on the rare occasion she lets her hair down, it reaches to just a few inches above her waist. Compared to other Sin’dorei, her eyes are strangely lightless rather than the luminescent gold or green of so many others. A spattering of light brown freckles cross her nose, dotting her cheeks. While slim, she isn’t quite muscular, though the tone in her arms and torso are quite apparent. \n\n     Elia tends to keep her clothing casual, often confused as to why someone would willingly wear armor if they weren’t expecting to need it. Similarly, she remains unarmed unless specifically doing something where she expects to need weaponry. As such, she keeps an extensive wardrobe, shying towards tops that expose her stomach and pants that conceal her legs. Still, it’s far from uncommon to see her in a dress, though she never wears one without wearing pants underneath, regardless of the length of the garment. Elia wears a silver chain around her neck that ends in a small oval emerald wrapped in silver, as well as two dangling emerald earrings.{/col} \n\n{h2:c}{col:92ff5b}It's harder to be yourself than it is to be anyone else.{/col}{/h2}\n\n{h1:c}{col:92ff5b}Personality{/col}{/h1}\n{col:92ff5b}While those who knew Elia when she first arrived to Orgrimmar met a bubbly, kind, and jubilant girl, her mask has fully crumbled away. Dropping her all-encompassing lively nature for good now. Elia remains a kind and warm woman, though decidedly more withdrawn than before. She’s quick to engage in a conversation, though much less frequently would seek such things out. While she continues to be an earnest friend always happy to lend a hand to help or shoulder to cry on, the ordeals of her last year have left her quick to let her mind wander to darker things, often resulting in a much more isolated girl than before.\n \n     To learn anything more than that, of course, one would have to approach her. That's how personalities work!{/col}\n\n{h1:c}{col:a3a3a3}Background{/col}{/h1}\n\n{h2:c}{col:a3a3a3}”No more shame, no more fear, no more dread.\"{/col}{/h2}\n\n{col:a3a3a3}Arriving in Orgrimmar a year ago, Elia desperately sought to begin anew and avoid the traumas she had faced over the last three years of her life. After nine months spent in Suramar filled with trials and tribulations that she failed to meet, she left everything she had behind and went to Orgrimmar on a whim, having never been to the city before. Determined not to fail as she had before, she brought nothing with her – including leaving her own name behind, adopting her middle name Sylvia instead.\n\nWithin the first few days of arriving in Orgrimmar, “Sylvia” had swiftly been welcomed by a large and friendly group, including the woman that would become her magic teacher and later her lover. Weaving a web of lies beneath those that had welcomed her like none had before, Elia worked in secret to fix an event that had haunted her past, constantly selling herself as someone else all the while. Eventually forced to pick between her new life full of loving and welcoming people or fixing her past, Elia ultimately abandoned her quest within days of the final moment, choosing to embrace her new life instead. \n\nLeft broken by the decision to abandon all that she had worked towards and the guilt of lying to those that had welcomed her, Elia once again planned to start over. Intending to leave Orgrimmar in silence and begin again elsewhere with a new name, she was talked out of such drastic measures by one who had influenced her decision to give up on her quest for good. Instead of attempting to start anew once more, Elia chose to confess to those that she had grown to love. Met once again with understanding and kindness, the girl chose to keep her new name while accepting who she had been, coming to terms with the traumas she had been forced to endure and looking forward to a better future for the first time in years. Answering now to either Elia or Sylvia, she does what she can to move closer to being a better version of herself.{/col}",

Or corrupted fel green eyes depending on the person's views. The woman had a semi rounded face with a somewhat defined chin as it was a rather delicate combination of fat and bone. Her makeup sometimes present and other times not, usually being full on red lipstick along with some eyeliner. She was a pretty average elf when it came to these sort of things, maybe a little below average on height, but definitely making up for it with her figure. Ara wasn't slim but instead held a bit of weight to her, having a nice rounded chest and rump, but it was all neatly tucked away by her devious leathers. The dark skin tight apparel was obvious the go to for these leather types and she certainly didn't disappoint. Accompanied with her own personal belt that held just a little bit of everything - Vials, pouches, a few throwing knife holsters and even a scroll holder. On the back of her belt however was a book that was neatly locked in place above her rump, sealed with a little ribbon but it seemed very held together. If one got a view underneath her armor they'd see a few scars here and there, a cut or two in her stomach region while also having a slash on her right shoulder and lastly the one across her back. As for the piercings and tattoos there shockingly wasn't many as the only jewelry she had was a navel piercing and earrings. The tattoo she had was strategically placed and not many got to see... Wherever it was it was certainly a mystery!\n\n{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n\n\n{img:Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-rogue-kingslayers:512:256}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{col:0013ff}{h3:c}OOC Information\n\nHer appearance is subject to change.

I have a hard time seeing my own mistakes.\n\nVoice claim is Kerillian from Warhammer Vermintide 2!\n\nChild RPers are kind of avoided. Don't be offended if I don't associate myself with you.\n\nIC is IC and OOC is OOC, please learn these things!\n\nI don't care that you are LGBTQ friendly.\n\nVulpera should not be allowed in slutmog.

She has two \"tusks\" on the bottom of her chin like her kin.\n\nHer tail looks heavy with the bulb at the end of it!  Probably don't want to get hit by that.

They're not too long, considered to be a 'medium' length; they jut upwards from her skull and then begin to gently curl back.\n\nWhen lacking anything to cover her 'eyes' or mouth, it would be obvious that she lacked eyes at all; having been plucked out from the Illidari rituals, what remains were the signature burning sockets. As for her teeth, however, instead of what should have been healthy, normal looking teeth would be a row of razor sharp fangs; the kind typically found in the mouth of a felstalker. A mutation given to her by her demonic soul bind. \n\nHer demonic soul bind has made her black, and somewhat long hair become hard to manage. Before she was fortunate enough to find magical hair care products, often her hair would have a 'wild mane' look to it, despite any other previous methods she typically used; often she used to look like she had just woken up and rolled right out of bed.\n\nSometimes Melantharia has piercings on her left horn, usually three rings going from near the tip down towards the mid section. When she is wearing those piercings, her soft lips tend to be pierced as well with two rings on her bottom lip on the right. Always, however, aong her right ear, Melantharia has several piercings on the tip of her ear, her lobe and the entirety of her left ear remains bare. As for any other jewelery, nothing stands out minus a ring on her left ring finger. The ring is made out of a combination of saronite and felsteel. The gemstone carved to look like a sun bound in chains. Occasionally energy seemed to flicker within the gemstone. \n\nOften Illidari love to show off their tattoos, and sometimes Melantharia's tops can be revealing; if wearing such an outfit, anyone could see the runic tattoos that decorated her pale, athletic body.  These enchanted runes ran across her chest, around her C-cupped breasts and down her arms; they fueled her abilities to consume magic and helped her to resist any magical damage that might have slipped by in combat.\n\n\nIf her choice of gloves for the day were something fingerless, or if she decided to forgo the gloves entirely, her nails appeared to be un-naturally sharp and could easily cut flesh if she wasn't careful with them. Often she kept them looking pretty and painted however.\n\nFurther down, Melantharia wore leather leggings that hugged them tightly, helping to display how toned she was. As if she did -plently- of running. \nMelantharia is the eldest twin, of which both eventually trained to become Illidari.\n\nBefore becoming demon hunters the two would always be mixed up, however after their training and demon bindings the pair became easier to tell apart. They both have different runes across their body, and have different style horns and hair styles. However even with this Melanthaira has occasionally still been mistaken for her sister by those who know them both.\n{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\ARCHEOLOGY\\ArchRare-Demons:512:256}\n{h1:c}Possible Rp Hooks{/h1}\n\n{h2:c}{col:41dc3b}The Would Be Ranger{/h2}\n\n{col:41dc3b} Rangers older than Melantharia may know her! In her younger years, Melantharia had dreams of becoming a Farstrider, and often was around the enclave within what is now the Ghostlands.  She would have been known as a hard worker, and one who took the craft seriously. She had a love for animals and even learned to tame a Lynx.{/col}\n\n{h2:c}{col:61fff9}The Magister{/h2}\n{col:61fff9}Melantharia's mother wouldn't -dare- raise a 'bow jockey'. But, Melantharia had displayed quite the talent for magic. Sent away to Dalaran, Melantharia spent a good number of years working on her craft. Others who would have been in Dalaran years before the Third war may have met Melantharia, either as fellow students, or someone who lived in the city. \n\nDuring the Third War; Melantharia served in Kael'thas' army, doing her duty to the Alliance until the Sin'dorei were labed as traitors for working with the Naga. Anyone who also served may have met or known of Melantharia before she became Illidari{/col}\n\n{h3:r}{col:7586ff}Just a little less elven and a lot more bitter and cold {/col} {/h3}\n\n{h2:c}{col:ff2c3b}The Beast{/h2}{/col}\n{col:ff2c3b}Any Illidari could possibly know of Melantharia, but Mela wasn't one of the demon hunters locked away by the wardens. While she didn't have the honor of being sent to Mardum and being part of the team that found the keystone, Mela instead spent those ten long years on other worlds, fighting the legion wherever they could till they were needed on Azeroth. \n\n Those other Illidari that weren't locked away, may look at Mela as someone to keep their 'eyes' on, after an incident on a world known as 'Shakurus' there was a time where Mela was thought to be a traitor. She eventually was cleared, but the stain of that time still sticks with her. {/col}\n\nYou guys like themes, right?

Prelude{/h3}\n\nPosturing, demagoguery and political hostility, followed by skrimishes. That's how all wars begin really, with words. The age old clash of dialogue or rather lack thereof. The case of an unstoppable force coming into contact with an immovable object. This climate of open hostility is what many young Orcs came of age into, and would see them thrust into a conflict that shook the very foundations of the world they knew, and would bring out the best and the worst in a generation.\n\n{h3:c}II. Escalation{/h3}\n\nAt first the individual Clans reacted the way they always had, shoving back hard when pushed and meeting the aggression of the Draenei in turn, but it would become clear that things were different this time. It was not a matter of land or resources to the Lightbound, they wanted submission. Submission to the Exarch leading them. Submission to the faith they preached. Submission to the Naaru. After a time it was obvious that they would never accept no for an answer, and the scale of their attacks only increased along with their fanatical zeal.\n\n{h3:c}III. Retaliation{/h3}\n\nBy the second year of the War it had become clear that no one clan of Orcs could stem the tide of the Lightbounds fanaticism. Every where the Clans saw defeat, and their territory shrink in the face of a far greater enemy. Desperate action was needed, a council was called, and so for only the second time in the history of the Orcish race upon Draenor, the clans put aside their differences and united as one. They would fight as one People, one Nation, one Horde. With a Warchief chosen from among the greatest of the leaders, the Mag'har would soon send their adversaries reeling in the face of a united effort, as other races of Draenor fell in line, their own survival also at stake.\n\n{h3:c}IV. Devastation{/h3}\n\nDespite the determination and might of the Mag'har, the war did not end quickly, but dragged on for many long and bloody years. While the desire for victory united the Clans, the demands of the great conflict would require new technologies, new industries and new sacrifices. Every year saw the nature of the war change, along with how it was fought. Every new tactic and strategy met by a countermeasure of the enemy and vice versa. From the cratered battlegrounds where thousands would lose their lives, to the deep scars in the earth from which minerals were stripped, and the great Factory-Forges where weapons were churned out endlessly, Draenor was marred. Draenor was scarred. Draenor would burn.\n\nStill despite the Mag'har's efforts it was clear toward the end that they were losing the War. With ever increasing casualties and many of their number falling victim to the Lightbinding of the Naaru or joining the enemy willingly, things were grim. The Orcish race and most of their allies would find themselves cornered in a few scattered territories and teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\n\n{h3:c}V. The War is Not Over{/h3}\n\nWith total defeat seeming immenent, the Mag'har prepared themselves for the final battle on the ruined plains of Gorgrond. As the remaining hours ticked by, pure chance or perhaps fate would intervene. When the last confrontation began travellers from another world the Iron Horde had once made war upon came forth calling in old favors for aid. Rather than see his people annihilated upon the field of battle, Warchief Grommash Hellscream ordered the Mag'har to depart with the travellers, and with only his Honor Guard in tow charged the enemy lines in a delaying action. \n\nArriving on the New World, the Mag'har would quickly recover from the shock of losing their home and Warchief of so many years, making good account of themselves fighting in the conflict being waged by the Horde of Azeroth. In all of their minds however is the ever present threat of the Lightbound and the fate of those Orcs who had to be left behind in the retreat. The Mag'har would carry on the struggle, until, in the Ancestor's good time, this New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the Old.",

Link grew up in the Eastern Kingdoms, raised mostly on human traditions and is highly unfamiliar with other vulpera cultures from Vol'dun. With her mother's influence, she attended a small magic school, mostly learning how to hex and summon, and so she is well talented in darker magic and always eager to learn more, despite many of the challenges she may face. The naive fox often gets herself into trouble, and therefore is also highly trained in the art of stealth, able to hide within the shadows when needed.\n\nAt just three years old, she lost her mother during a witch hunt, leaving her with nobody else to raise her but her older sister, Lilith; however, Link's curiosity would eventually lead her to leaving the secluded environment of her safe-haven and making her way into the world alone. She spent much of her time searching empty tombs, learning, watching. Trying to become better and be just like her mother and sister. Now, she has found a new life, traveled among Kalimdor and discovered the allied Vulpera with the horde. Here she has learned how to make new friends and allies, although.. her roots may never change. \n\nLink's vampirism is a recent infection of only a few months, turned with the aid of a San'layn master, she now has the same thirsts and cravings as any other Vampyr, she embraces and fully accepts the gift, even seeming somewhat proud of it.. The infection has caused various mutations within her body such as long pointy bat-like ears, a slightly more pointy nose, a long set of fangs,  and the ability to nagivate dark areas with ease.{/p} \n\n\n\n\n{h2:c}[Character Traits]{/h2}\n{p:c}•Very Naive and often in trouble\n\n•They are lustful, and wil tease\n\n•They can be rather arrogant\n\n•They have a long set of fangs, most visible when she smiles\n\n•They're  very skittish\n\n•They have tall bat-like ears\n\n•She always carries a spell book\n\n•They have vampiric thirst and desires{/p}\n\n\n\n\n{h2:c}[Character Weaknesses]{/h2}\n{p:c}•Link is extremely sensitive to the light, any spells cause her great discomfort or pain and light attacks have the potential to kill her.\n\n•The sunlight is an extreme weakness, due to her vampirism. She is often seen in hoods to for this reason.\n\n•Those who can control, or shackle undead can stop Link in her tracks easily.\n\n•Her ears are sensitive, a softer takedown method!{/p}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{h3:c}[Extra Information]{/h3}\n{p:c}(TRP is a WIP still, thanks for reading!

Now defending it against the prince he thought would join them. Thinking his faith strong, he was cut down like the rest. The exact details are blurry. Gnarled hands, a cold weapon, and a wretched grin. How many days did he spend in the darkness, a booming voice in his mind telling him to slaughter and kill all who still drew breath? When Francis finally regained control, there was only one person to follow. The only one to have a plan, Sylvanas. Using his newfound strength and powers granted to him in undeath, he carved a new bloody path serving the Banshee Queen. Making sure she alone ruled their once great nation. ",

His pendant and accessories were all crafted from bone, a mix of sethrak and vulpera harvested fresh from the source. His scarred body holds the brandings of a slave, likely one that escaped and cut a bloody path to freedom. Anzou's past may be a lost period of time but his body tells this tale for him. It is a tale of suffering and survival. He was isolated and removed from the rest of his kind and preyed upon the sethrak and exiles for supplies and food. Anzou developed a reputation in that time as the one who wore the bones of his victims, the vulpera who would dare to engage in cannibalism. He was disinterested in friendships or joining caravans, preferring instead for a more individual nomadic experience. His temporary cave homes carry the blood paintings and bone sculptures he so enjoyed crafting. Decaying remains often lined the floor, organised in a way that almost seemed deliberate. \n\nThe Fourth War made its way to the sands of Vol'dun. As the hunter of Sethrak, Anzou aided the slave revolt unintentionally by prowling through the heart of Faithless territory. He would silently strike at sethrak he deemed worthy prey, which unintentionally aided the Horde's interests. Anzou would eventually be approached by Forsaken, which immediately caught his interest. His fascination with death only seemed to grow as he watched the sentient undead. The Voldunai had already allied themselves to the cause and it seemed they mistook Anzou as yet another slave or caravan guard. This mistake did not trouble the eccentric vulpera. He was all too pleased to aid the Horde as his task was simply to kill sethrak. Much to his own dismay, Anzou found himself forced to engage in socialisation with his fellow vulpera.\n\nA choice was to be made, a difficult choice that involved forcing himself to engage society. Anzou wished to spend more time with the Forsaken and observe how they chose to live. He wished to leave the sethrak infested misery of Vol'dun. Yet part of him feared the outside world. He did not enjoy conversation and he did not respect his fellow vulpera. In the end the decision presented itself with a sort of randomness, an impulsive desire that carried him from his desert trappings. He finally left Vol'dun but he found his habits too difficult to abandon. Anzou's talents were in the killing of others and in the harvesting of bones and organs. He was not a merchant or trader. He did not wish to be a guard. Mercenary work seemed worthless. All he wished was the continuation of his ritual. The Horde offered much for a killer. There was an abundance of enemies to hunt. \n\nAnzou was skilled as a tracker and could step unheard through the sands but he also practised a primitive form of shamanism that empowered his weapons. The Horde's farseers and shamans had taught him to take a new form, that of a mighty raptor spirit. Anzou seemed all too pleased to act the part of a vicious dinosaur. It fed into his bloodlust. He was growing accustomed to this form when he ventured to Uldum. Another desert and even more enemies to kill, yet he noticed Uldum was vastly superior to Vol'dun. The tol'vir were cultured and grew crops. They had grand magnificent structures and statues. They were a thriving people compared to the sethrak. And the enemies he observed were unlike any other. Faceless creatures and giant insects radiating shadow. These creatures resembled the tortured nightmares he endured through childhood. They resembled the very things he scrawled along cave walls so long ago. N'Zoth, that was the name of their creator. Anzou had long dreamed of these distorted aberrations and now he was to destroy them in the name of the Horde. He felt conflicted.\n\nThe carapace of the aqir was sturdy and impressive. Anzou took to crafting with the material. He also began to pillage and collect the void tainted weapons left by the cultists of N'Zoth. These treasures were valued and prized within his collection. He had always enjoyed finding relics and valuables among the sands of Vol'dun but nothing in that desert could compare to the magnificence of the organic pulsing weapons and armour of the Black Empire. In time, Anzou returned from Uldum with a sizable treasure hoard and a satisfaction of finally understanding his dreams and nightmares. His inability to relate and integrate into vulpera culture was a barrier that only worsened upon his return to Orgrimmar. His desire to revert to the old ways of his nomadic murderous life tempted him daily.",

Held precious to him, a woven dreamcatcher hangs from a leather cord around his neck. He claims it is the Eye of Taronhe, his dear mentor who gave it to him. \n\n•His warpaint is an echo to his past. The red on top represents his unwavering loyalty to the Horde while the blue on bottom represents his birth as a Grimtotem of Stonetalon. (Blue appears to be evident on Grimtotem totems throughout the region.) He also bears a brand of the Horde on the outside of his upper right shoulder.\n\n•A bit vain, Tauros rarely covers himself fully, preferring to stand about with his physique on full display. When he catches someone staring, he is known to even flex with a wink and a smile. He is never shy about showing off and will do so at every chance he can.\n",

Pretty lady seems very nice. Yes, yes!~{/col}{/h3}\n\nWhile this woman’s demonic features are her most prominent quality, smaller nuances about her can be noticed as well. The first of which is the necklace she wears. A fine silver chain hangs from her neck, which eventually leads down to a thicker section that intricately coils around a green jewel and cradles it within a silver cage. At times, this pointed gem glows with a brighter green light that drifts within the crystal with a mind of its own, though it often seems to “shut off” on its own for brief periods of time. Astute observers may also notice a cockroach that seems obsessed with following this woman, though that fascination is strictly one-sided, she doesn't appear to pay it much mind at all. How odd.\n\n{h3:c}{icon:ability_demonhunter_darkness:50}{/h3}\n{h2:c}{col:ff00f5}OOC{/col}{/h2}\nSeyliah is an oddity. Like most Illidari, she does have her dark qualities, but they're generally overshadowed by her bubbly disposition, surprising naivety, and eccentric speech. Always happy and approaching new people to make friends, this demon huntress is always trying to spread smiles. She will absolutely melt at head pats, pets, and general stroking of her hair. Be warned!~\n\nThis player is 21+, if that matters to you, and has a decade of RP experience, if that also matters to you. I adore most dark, horror, and mature themes, despite the cheery surface of the character. Light-hearted interactions are great too, I like most things. One thing I love, is lengthy and detailed emotes. Please hit me with those! The one thing I prefer to avoid is ERP. Flirting is fine, romance is fine, but I'd rather not do the sex thing, thanks. I'm totally down to make friends with contacts, but I mostly stick to PvP when it comes to WoW, so I may be someone who you mostly just talk to rather than do PvE things with. FFXIV is my main game for that, for a very good reason. ^^;\n",

Judge me not by my methods, but by what I seek to accomplish.”\n\nHistory:\n\nFormerly known as Prince Valron Silverblood, the Sorcerer-Prince, and better known as in his much younger years as, Prince of Llothien.\nValron, very much like Meitre and Archmage Tarsis Kir-Moldir was one of the few surviving Highborne & one of the most prestigious sorcereres of Ancient Kalimdor.\n\nValron has always been ambitious & was born a prodigy of the Arcane Arts. To understand the vast extent of magic, Valron often excluded himself from the politics of Kaldorei & Highborne society in favor of his studies, so much so that it led him to seek out the tutelage of the Blue Dragonflight proper. \n\nDuring his long excursions from Kaldorei society, Valron went through rigorous training sessions of spellweaving and studying leylines. By the time his tutelage was complete, he became one of the first Leywalkers and a Dragonsworn of the Blue Dragonflight as a result.\n\nAfter rejoining Kaldorei civilization, Valron was approached & inducted into the Moonguard, where he would futher develop and hone his skills as a Spell-Fencer & Spellbreaker for years leading up the first invasions on the Legion.\n\nIt was thought that Valron had been slain during the War of the Ancients or was dragged to the bottom of the Well of Eternity during the Sundering but it seems now with his re-emergence, he has indeed survived the chaos and simply disappeared into quiet seclusion after the the War of the Ancients.\n\nIn the aftermath he has utilized his amassed knowledge of the Arcane & has since traveled through time & across the Twisting Nether in search for powerful artifacts, relics & exotic magics. In his travels, he's made deals with a host of evil & villainy so wretched...all for the sake of creating the Highborne anew & redeem his once noble people.\n\nRecent History:\n\nValron returns to Azeroth as an elusive, secretive, and well informed de facto leader of the Empyrean Syndicate. \n\nValron's name and his life before Empyrean are both long forgotten by most. For years, Valron has been using sorcerey and his immense network of contacts to achieve his goal - that of making Azerothians ascendant above all other races in the cosmos. He has often been described as having the best and worst traits of elves rolled into one man.\n\nApperance:\n\nValron has a rugged yet youthful appearance about him dispite his true age. He is tall, dark & handsome by elven standards and sports a short black beard and medium length hair. \n\nUnderneath his enchanted blindfold are a pair of eyes, one gold and the other silver. Upon further inspection, you might notice the palms of both his hands have runes seemingly craved into them. If ever seen uncovered by his garb, one would discover a litany of the infernal scarification of runes littering his flesh.\n\nHis complexion is on the fairer side, almost oilve. He could easily be mistaken for a very tall Quel'dorei..and strangely enough he seems to appear to be a midway point between a Night elf and High elf after the exiled Highborne left on their voyage.\n\nPersonality: Sarcasim, Dry humor and Elven arroganace, with as dash of compassion.\n\n",

During the legion invasion of Suramar, he found himself fighting with the resistance hoping to make a change. Unfortunately, he had gotten into more trouble than he could handle while assisting a mother and her child get to safety. He thought all was well, as long as he could protect his people during his final moments. Then it happened: he was struck down by a demon's axe. As time passed, he suddenly felt something. To his surprise, he was alive and standing, but he didn’t know where. As he looked around he saw what looked to be knights in full armor. After being drawn to the Lich King, he was told what lied ahead.  {/p}\n\n{h2:c}In Life Once More{/h2}\n{p:c}With his new life and lack of memories, he set out to protect his people’s new home amongst the Horde. His life in undeath, unfortunately, brought him into the battle at Darkshore. During this time, he had to learn how to combat his hunger and rage. There was a struggle, but he managed to get in under control through the battle’s end. With his free time, he had decided to educate himself on the world beyond Suramar, both with reading and first-hand experience. By the time the war ended, he had become as knowledgeable as any other Nightborne was. However, with less required of him in times of peace between the Alliance and Horde, a decision was made to take up smithing.\n\n{/p}\n\n{h2:c}Physical Description{/h2}\n{p:c}The tattos on his tattoos glow an icy white and some runes can be seen among them. His face is on average for his people yet carries a few noticeable scars, the largest of which is a faint slash mark across his left eye. His face’s remaining scars make it seem as if he had some near misses with arrows and other projectiles. His body is currently semi muscular. The scars on his body followed along with his face’s wounds. The worst of his scars lays on his lower back to the right of his spine. Looking at it would lead you to think a pillar had shot through him, yet only a scar on where it entered was visible. Further, his lack of a proper left hand may grab your eyes’ attention when his gauntlets are off.Though dead there is no visible decay for  he some how preserve himself with his dying breath. \n\n\n{/p}\n\n\n\n\n{p:c}Has aproximate knoledge of many things{/p}",

A being of great mass, Thrator has no care for what obstacles lie in his way. Ebon plate as dark as the void clings to his immense form, grass green skin invisible beneath dark chainmail and iron armor. Shoulders as broad as the mouth of Menethil Harbor carry round shoulder-plates adorned with ebon spikes that threaten to puncture the clouds, and beneath them iron mitts that protect the Orc's gargantuan palms. At his helm, iron spikes vertically align at the center of his head just above a burning red visage of which is horizontal at the top and vertical at the center, all the way down to the bottom of his iron bucket. The red mist that emanates from his form threatens to brand the souls of those who dare mirror his gaze. A dark shroud hides most of his black armor, covering all of his back and curving around at the front. The cloak often brushes away at the ground behind his stride, leaving only a faint breeze where one of death's harbingers walked. {/col}\n\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:ba0006}Truth, Blade of the Red Star {/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{col:ffbc27}At his back, hiding beneath his pitch black shroud, a cursed, lightless, harrowing instrument of death would find it's resting place. Once a sword and shield for a warrior of the stars, whose strength was absolute but inferior to his grace's, it's steel had been broken and reforged many times. Repurposed now for a great warrior who rained down the hounds of hell upon those who opposed him, the weapon held dominion over all the beasts and atrocities it's masters had wrought. It's name, Truth, bestowed upon it due to it's ability to create new truth's in which it's master survived. The ability to slay is something powerful... the pathway to something many fail to understand.{/col}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:ba0006} Iron Lord of the North {/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{col:ffbc27} Thrator is all but friendly. He wants nothing but to achieve his goals, and does not have time for idle conversation. You will likely never see him inside the city walls of either faction, having completely departed from the faction war after the burning of Teldrassil and the attack on Lordaeron, and subequently Sylvanas' betrayal. If your character wishes to interact with him, do not expect it to be anywhere busy. Thrator is a goal-driven, hate-filled, seen-it-all, unhinged Master of Arms with his own agenda that he intends on following.\n\n \n{h3:c}{col:ba0006} OOC Information {/col}{/h3}\n\n {link*https://imgur.com/gallery/BEojwNa*Art by @catbatart on Twitter}\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/2KKgt7q*Art by @epistafy1 on Twitter}\n\nIf you have any questions, are interested in this character's storytelling, or have any inquires about him whatsoever, do not be afraid to whisper! \n\nThrator may not like you, but I promise I do! \n\nDon't expect me to RP Thrator very much in game. Hundreds of pages of storytelling through Google docs and whatnot have made this character one of my most prized posessions. I do not want to force him on anyone, and while he is powerful, he does not break lore in any form or fashion. I pride myself on my ability to stay obedient to the main continuity of the game and I don't assume that my character could compete with any of the major powers in the game's story at all. \n\nP.S. No, Thrator doesn't want to stick his meat in you. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Decorating it, she's got a few rabbit's feet, some small animal bones tucked into bands on her wrists and legs.  She even has a small wolf jawbone hanging around her neck.  The spear she carries looks old - covered in vines...but maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  Decorated with feathers hanging off it's shaft (giggity).  Her tail seems like it's been chewed on...since it's missing a bit of fur about halfway down it's length.  But, to make up for that, she's got a bright blue feather looped and tied around the lil tuft at the end.  A few pouches hang from her waist, nothing fancy, just old beast hides stitched together to make a few small bags.  Her hood also covers her ENTIRE mane(unlike the model) and nearly covers her face, too.  Most people would at least be able to see the green paint streaking her chin and nose with a blue line going across the center of her face.  Her scent is that of...dirt.  Since she lives in the wilds.  She smells like dirt...maybe a hint of pine sap...foresty stuffs.\nShe may seem quiet at first, but she'll eventually open up.

For her race, Nandrea is considered of average height and beauty. Though of course, to the more mundane races her beauty might be overwhelming. Long elven ears perk almost straight up from her raven-black hair which falls to her shoulders in a simple curled appearance, If touched her hair feels slightly silky which suggests she takes good care of it. Her face is normally makeup free while her features are smooth and angular which flows with her hair. Her ears were also unpierced. She can often give off a very cold look when she wishes to simply because of how her face is constructed, But her disposition seems to be quite the opposite at times. No piercings are noted on her face and she kept it clean, most of the time. She also has a very small scar that ran vertically along her left cheek, the sign of a very close call in the past. And along her neck was a necklace with a golden cylinder and a glowing arcane crystal on the end of it, obviously of sentimental value to the Farstrider. \n\n\nHer body was slightly curvy and toned, fit muscle, while not lacking for agility, with tapered hips that flared out slightly and she had a decently ample bosom, for a blood elf at the very least to give her a bit of a toned figure that was close to an hourglass shape, while retaining the litheness that was the norm for blood elven women. Her legs were toned as well, suggesting she was quite a fast runner, while also sporting a slight thigh gap. And when seen out of her armor, Nandrea's body is adorned with dark tiger stripe pattern tattoos colored a deep rich crimson color, the tattoos wrapped around the entirety of her forearms, along the sides of her torso, her thighs and calves. The elf also had a massive tattoo of a phoenix that spanned the majority of her back, set in the center with it's majestic wings spread far and wide over her shoulderblades and the feathered tips barely curving over the shoulders while burning feathers and arcane stars fall from the majestic bird, a symbol of the sin'dorei indomitable spirit and tendency to rise anew from the lowest points in their life, and the reason Nandrea got this elaborate, brilliantly detailed and enchanted tattoo was no different. On Nandrea's left shoulder she also had the symbol of the Night Fae covenant inked into her shoulder with brilliant blue shimmering and glowing ink that was often used in Ardenweald as the ink branched down her bicep in large lines like roots from a seed planted by the covenant's symbol that that stopped at her elbow almost like an armlet, obviously this tattoo was meant to show her loyalty to the Night Fae and the Winter Queen after proving herself, reserving her own place in the afterlife should she ever fall. Even with all this ink adorn the elf's body they do little to hide the different kinds of scars that dot some of her sun-kissed body, mostly blade and claw marks on her arms, legs, and the one on her face.\n\n\n\n\n{h1:c}Weapons and Equipment{/h1}\n\n{icon:INV_Chest_Mail_RaidHunterMythic_Q_01:25} - Ranger's Chain: A suit of thorium scalemail armor, Nandrea is usually seen wearing this when out and about. The armor is styled in an elven fashion given a rich white, black and teal color scheme, the armor was clearly built for a veteran marksman who had a preference for mobility, protection and style all rolled into one package. Under the armor itself would be knothide leather padding that hugged closely against her figure while not being too constricting. Set into the shoulders, gloves, thigh plates and her boots would be glowing yellow gems containing swirls of magical energy, Obviously to keep with the sin'dorei's reputation for magical aesthetics in much of what they craft. The cloak is made of mageweave cloth dyed with a mix of black and white, with gold trims and twin emeralds engraved into the top and bottom bits of the cloak, giving Nandrea a somewhat regal appearance that was the norm for Sin'dorei. And typically, Nandrea would wear the Sunreaver tabard or the tabard of the order she serves. And more often than not, she'd have a hood raised over her head but it did little to hide the glow of her eyes, nor that scar on her face or her raven-black hair.\n\n\n{icon:INV_Bow_1h_ArtifactWindrunner_D_06:25} - {col:ff4000}Taran'vas, Wrath of the Thalassian Warden{/col}: An intricate bow infused with magical energies from Life, Fire and the Arcane, Taran'vas is indeed a weapon worthy of a Farstrider. The bow was wrapped in vines with flowers that often bloomed and closed up.  Often paired with an quiver slung across Nandrea's back. Itched into the 'wings' of the bow close to the openning where Nandrea fires her arrows through the vines that are wrapped around it, at the left wing would be, for those who can translate thalassian: 'No Sacrifice', and on the other wing 'No Victory'. Judging from it's age, the bow was recently created for Nandrea by the bowmakers from both Silvermoon and Suramar, who dipped the bow into the Sunwell to imbue the weapon with astounding power. Such a gift was given to her after proving herself worthy of it, and woe to those who end up in the weapons reach, for when the energies in the bow are focused, the arrows fired at that interval cause thorny vines to wrap and tangle over it's victims. And on the other hand, the infusion of embers from Nandrea's old bow, Phoenixstrike have carried over her 'Phoenix Shot'. Which causes the arrows she fires to sometimes conjure up a vibrant phoenix that hurls itself towards it's target and explodes, singing the area around it and those caught within it, but takes a lot of power out of the bow and needs a long while to recharge it magics by drinking of ambient leylines in Nandrea's travels.\n\n{icon:INV_Sword_59:25} - {col:ff2800}Sunseeker, Sword of the Father{/col}: A rather sharp sin'dorei warblade enchanted with flames and a never dulling edge, this sword once belonged to Nandrea's father, Calidan Phoenixfeather. Often sheathed at her side along her left hip for those extra special moments when her enemies get nice and close. The sword's crossguard had a flaming rune itched into the center, causing the blade's flames to ignite when drawn from the leather scabbard. The reach and curve of the weapon met nothing but agony for Nandrea's enemies, showing that not even they are safe from the Farstrider's fury when up close and personal.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{h1:c}OOC Section{/h1}\nTheme: Horizon: Zero Dawn OST - Main Theme: {link*https://tinyurl.com/ycqa7uz4*https://tinyurl.com/ycqa7uz4}   (For Non-TRP Users: https://tinyurl.com/ycqa7uz4)\n\nVoice Claim: Kari Wahlgren as Aranea Highwind in Final Fantasy XV {link*https://tinyurl.com/y6smgems*https://tinyurl.com/y6smgems}\n\n-Her nickname 'The Black Wolf of The Ghostlands' is one that's kind of recognizable by the military folk of Silvermoon, like the Blood Knights and her fellow Farstriders, and there would be whispers of that nickname amongst the higher crust of Thalassian society, so feel free to have them recognize/remember hearing of that moniker or the one who bears it.\n\n\n-If your character is a Nightborne who witnessed the Dusk Lily rebellion in Suramar, feel free to recognize Nandrea, for she had her own hand in that conflict.\n\n-Nandrea is often seen traveling with her trusty owl, affectionately named Hootie, if not him than she accompanied by her black raptor Umbra, her panthara Eranu, Her Frost Wolf, Snowfang or her black Vulpin, Vix.",

Feel free to whisper me if you'd like a shared backstory, or if you would like to have known Catora through her associates among the Irontide Pirates, smugglers, gambling rings, underground fight clubs, black markets, or via her former master- a sethrak trader named Sekriss.{/col}{/p}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Always IC all the time, except when explicitly marked.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{icon:inv_knife_1h_artifactskulloferedar_d_03:25}{/h3}\n{h3:c}{col:FF7F00}Physical Description{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Cat is of average height for a vulpera, with a fit build. She has bright blue-green eyes and large pointed ears pierced with several gold earrings. Scars are visible where her skin shows through her armor, and several notches have been taken out of her ears. Her interest typically wavers quickly and she can be found peering around at nearby things or people, with a preference for obvious signs of value.{/col}{/p}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Her armor and equipment are ragged and old, patched together out of spare odds and ends she has been given or found (or \"found\") throughout her life. Among them are pieces of Alliance and Horde equipment alike. She is strung with spare throwing knives and good luck charms, including an elaborate soulcatcher hung from her belt that she is never separated from.{/col}{/p}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Her weapons are clearly ancient, a pair of wickedly sharp, curved daggers. Years of applied poisons cling to their surfaces in a film of oily black death, the occasional drip landing with a faint hiss. Eldritch energy has been imbued into the blades, the distinct sense of having been created far from where they have found themselves now.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}{icon:inv_stave_2h_deathwingraiddw_d_01:25}{/h3}\n{h3:c}{col:FF7F00}The Shadow's Daughter{/col}{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}Those capable of sensing magic such as demon hunters are able to detect a strange enchantment clinging to Catora, though she is no magic-user. Her movements occasionally flicker or stutter with licks of flame, particularly when performing intricate sleights of hand as if she's a half-step out of sequence with her physical form, and her spirit has been bolstered by an ancient, near elemental power. There is no clear root to this gift, though it almost feels as if she is being shadowed or protected- the blessing of a distant patron manifesting as her unnatural abilities.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{p:c}{col:FF7F00}Thank you for reading <3{/col}{/p}\n\n\n",

She is built sturdily with thick musculature and a hardy physique well earned. Years of wafare have made her rugged and worn, and her skin bears the scarring to prove it.\n\nHer features are more broad and squared, lacking much \"feminine\" charm. Her tusks are longer and more pronounced than some females, and her short crest of deep green hair doesn't do much to add to her appeal. Sharp, crimson eyes always seem to be watching... and judging.\n\nTraditional Warsong tattooing maps her skin, set deep in her pale green hide. Little bones are pushed through her earlobes and through her septum, but aside from this she lacks any real ornamentation- it would just get in the way when fighting.\n{/col}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:960c11}{icon:warrior_skullbanner:40}Personality{/col}{/h3}\n\n\n{col:FF633B}Brash, curt, and stubborn as a mule, Thekra is not an easy orcess to get along with. She speaks her mind and does not hold back her thoughts or opinions. A natural seeker of thrills and challenges- she always seems to be getting into more than she can handle... and somehow living to tell the tale.\n\nShe lives for the thrill of battle and the hardship of war. Forever seeking honor and glory- she is a proud Warsong.{/col}\n\n\n{h3:c}{col:960c11}{icon:inv_banner_tolbarad_horde:40}History{/col}{/h3}\n\n{col:FF633B}A veteran of many battles, a familiar face on many warfronts, and a proud soldier, Thekra has spent much of her life consumed in warfare. Her only living family is her younger brother, her parents having died.. less than honorably. For further details... one would have to get to know her.{/col}\n",

Riches and luxury as he wished. Although, said life was brief, as the merchant family soon ended up in a huge debt and by mysterious accidents, the fortune and name was brought down, aswell as even some of the families lives, that is.\n\nThe orphan now was taken by a friend of the family to live away in a secure and reclusive place. Always keeping in motion, his protector took him to the Darkmoon Faire, where the Goblin grew up learning circus arts, even more those focused at fire juggling and fire dancing.\n\nAlways a supersticious one, once per month the Goblin checked out his fortune with fortune tellers that lived in the Faire. Every month, the same fortune was given, mounds of sands, eternal heat, a prize to be taken, only after the flames engulf him while in the dry and darker woods. On his heart, there was always a concern for that, but, one night after the defeat of the Legion, there were rumors of a suspicious figure taking shelter in the woods nearby the Faire.\n\nZyrept and a small other group were in charge of investigate it, the travel didn't led them far, as when they reached out the depths, they would be greeted by a dieing Warlock and a bound Succubus to him. As if pure instinct, the Warlock assaulted the group, incinerating most of them with his dying breath. The group then attacked the Warlock, putting him out of his misery and then turning his attention to the Succubus, a fiend and yet soo beautiful. Zyrept didn't resisted her charms at first, when he saw himself, he stabbed the couple few of the group to secure the life of the Succubus.\n\nOnce she was safe, as a reward for him saving her life, she gave him a soulstone necklace and a grimoire, proof of her bound to the old Warlock, and now, on his possession. The soul of the Warlock yet still resides in it, and it's energy and the Succubus soon taught the Goblin manipulations of forbidden magic that he never even had seen before, only heard about it in tales.\n\nHe turned his back on the Faire on the same night. Knowing he would be probably persecuted, he fled back to the desert of Tanaris, where he met a caravan of travelling artists. A wandering circus per se. With that, he and the group began to travel distances making small fortunes and presentation, which one day, led them to the sands of Uldum.\n\nIt was common to apply scams with street arts, pickpocketing people, stealing relics and gold. But this time? This time none of this worked. The people of Uldum, unique and fearsome, mistrusted their intentions on the very beginning, and on the first scam caught, the whole group were tossed deep beneath some haunted tomb to die and be consumed by the spirits in there.\n\nZyrept was the only one that escaped. A tale that once asked? He always offer a different story. Once thing is for certain, he escaped certain death while the others did not. And left the tombs with old jewerly and an unique shortsword.\n\nOne may only wonder what transpired inside these tomb and what lies ahead, for the Goblin.\n\n\n{/col}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\n{img:Interface\\PVPFrame\\Icons\\prestige-icon-8-1:128:128}\n\n{h1:c}{col:bca95b}º Appearance º{/col}{/h1}\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:32}\n\n{link*https://tinyurl.com/yxtvbvhe*Art done by the amazing AccessInvalid!}\n\n{col:ffcfb1}Standing at 3'9 of height, the Goblin was one exemple of height that his kin can reach to. His blonde is well kept and clean. Seems like he do pay attention to his looks.\n\nDown to his face, the Goblin would have an oddly calm one, moving from the large forhead to the prominent chin. The nose was large and pointy as many of his kin, of course, it was large, while the tip was slightly upwards, giving him a certain disdainful natural expression, even more when he smile.His ears are large in size, floppy and with a proper arch upwards. without any single adornement, even if there's a bit missing at one ear, a wound long healed. His eyes are purple, a pale coloration of purple, which only assist the whole possible-friendly looking from his part.\n\nAs for his body, the Goblin's skin is of a dark olive green coloration. Not covered by any scars or whatsoever. Arms have hair over most of it's extension, thin hair and black that is barely noticable if you don't pass your hands over it. If one would see Zyrept without his clothes or armor? Would see that the Goblin's body is toned. More then his arms allow people to see. Owner of a natural strenght developed over the years of intense labor and fighting, the muscular frame makes him an obvious strong speciemen of his kind, even if once again, there was not a signal of scars over his whole body.{/col}",

His life was a difficult one and he wasn't given the best hand. He was born the illegitimate child, and never met his father. His mother took care of him alone and was one of the lower caste Trolls. She had not a place to stay, nor a table to put food on.\n\nBut she took care of Izi. She made enough money through different methods than usual, she played street games. She usually rigged dice and whatnot to make money, only moving a few corners down the street if people found out of her plans. Once Izi was old enough to walk and lift things, he was sent to work.\n\nThe Troll usually did heavy lifting on the docks or cleaned up the dino crap on the streets when needed. but it wasn't a good way to make money at all. Izi one one of his workdays found a poster down by the docks. It was a bounty poster. It tasked the people to bring in the head of a certain Zi'kel, the reward was a measly ten gold for a dangerous man. It was a horrible deal to say the least.\n\nIzi set out into the jungles, wanting to make his mother proud and he somehow succeeded in killing the target, he brought in his head and his mother praised him for his deed, mostly just paying attention to that ten gold though.\n\nAs the years went on Izi took on more and more bounties, when he was fifteen he was a full on bounty hunter, one of the most reliable ones Zandalar had.\n\nThe only thing holding him back was his dear old mom, taking each and every single copper that he made during his bounties. He was fed up and thought he had given his mother plenty of chances to move on from this lifestyle and to stop wasting what they had earned. He left her on her own after a massive arguement in his mid teens.\n\nLife was looking up for Izi after this point. he was making plenty of money by himself, but he was a strange Troll by all means, he never went to the city and spent all of his time in the jungles, hunting or in his cave. His only appearences in public were so that he could collect bounty posters and turn in targets. He became \"Izi'fon\" the strange, flirty, button pusher but smart when it came to taking down his targets.\n\nOnce the Zandalari empire had become allies with the horde he made his way straight to durotar, excited for what his new allies had to offer him, new work? New people to bother? That's all he could ever want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{/col}\n\n\n{h1:c}{col:ffffff}Extra stuff{/col}{/h1}\n\n{col:ffffff}\nIzi is an extremely skilled bounty hunter, if your character has a bounty on them that will bring in a noticeable sum of gold, he will most likely know about it, feel free to whisper me about it if that's the case!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{/col}\n\n",

				["TX"] = "\"No, no! Easy!\" the tauren said, extending his hand toward the vicious snarl of an oversized brute of a black bear. It was difficult to make out the surroundings as the forest was unusually dark. Though his hand was fixated toward the bear, it was more than just a means to keep the creature at bay. An attempt to soothe the creature was made through with little luck.\n\nHe knew that look, that sudden hunkering down before an unruly charge. \"Oh. Oh, no.... No! Bad!\" he stutters before letting his palm fall, making an attempt to scramble behind something. A dash of his own left his hooves to sleep upon piles of dead leaves and withered bark. A quick leap grants him a bit of shelter behind a rock through the silence of the bear brought him a bit of concern. The tauren blinks, looking about, carefully rising to peer and scout the area.\n\nAt the same time, almost comically, the ursine managed to poke his head toward the tauren at the exact same time. There he was, inches from his face, a sneer growing across his maw. The bull then took a deep breath and slowly backed away from the giant rock. The bear didn't follow. Instead, the march of the beast came to circle about as if claiming the area. Once understood, the animal began to nudge and bump into a nearby tree that had a familiar hum and insect murmur.\n\nFrom atop of the dead sylvian came falling a lively beehive. The spoils were all for the bear, though he was distracted enough to allow the druid to work his natural abilities. Like before, his palm lifts and attempts to soothe the beast. It wouldn't be hard after all as the brute was munching down on a combination of insect and honeycomb. After the successful bond, the bear then approached the druid with what remained of the hive. It wasn't much, but perhaps enough to make a peace offering.\n\n\"Ah, thank the Earth Mother... Thank you, friend. You scared me. I meant you no harm!\" he tries to explain, though the beast couldn't reply with words. Instead, it huffs and resumes the patrol for more sweet, tasty delights. Of course, the tauren would follow close, hoping that bear would share a few more conquered wild bee colonies.",
