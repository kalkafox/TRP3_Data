He seems to share such a respectful atmosphere for anyone near him, despite his abhorrent, decrepit, antagonistic look.{/col}{/p}\n\n{img:Interface\\Challenges\\challenges-copper:128:128}\n\n{h1:c}{col:ff3e41}The Red Herring (Backstory){/h1}{p:c}{col:ffffff}\nA captivating night sky blanketed over the globular horizon that encompassed the hills and trails of the sand-filled dunes, knolls and bluffs of the shiny shale seemed to stretch for miles, hills and valleys constructed by nothing more than the processes of meteorological wind. If stars could make sound, the entire sky would be filled with it. Endless splotches peppered the sky, some twinkling and some large in size. Within the vast, boundless ambit of soil, lied a dimly-lit wooden structured carriage that was quite ample for a small family, but it was certainly enough space for the two occupants to navigate comfortably, for the time being. For the night, they had been nestled abscondly within the reaches of a cliff that overlooked a part of the sandy hills, next to an enclosed cave that showed no signs of illumination or life within, but was certainly highlighted by the inescapable reflective rays of the moon's gleam toward the valley.\n\nInside the mobile wooden vehicle, which was well structured enough to keep cozy comfort, was occupied by two male Vulpera of the same stature, but very distinct from the color of their fur. Each of them were donned with the garments akin to that of their race's heritage armor, but fitted for more comfort, and with a seal that seemed to symbolize the caravan's family icon. The red-furred Vulpera was decorated with splotches of purple, attributed to his markings, with a much shorter snout than the other darker orange Vulpera sitting beside him. The retinas of his eyes beamed with a rich, pure mahogany color, whilst the nameless orange fox carried a lilac color along his iris. The name tag printed on the fabric of the red fox's tabard read, 'USKO PERIKATO'. Both of them sat idly across eachother, a few scattered empty bottles against the well-defined timber that made up the table they used. Usko let off a stifled boisterous exhale of laughter, as it certainly seemed like he was considerably under the influence, but not so much to render him as innate as most would consider. He set the bottle of cider aside, as the orange Vulpera did the same. They were seemingly trading a joke about something. Usko broke the silence in the room for a moment, his smooth voice reverberating through the enclosed wooden walls.\n\n\"I mean, like-- Thankfully we don't have to do all that work tomorrow! Your ol' man said we can spread it out over the weekend. It's been, like, HELLA tough comin' through these part of the dunes, but even my dad says it's a piece of cake, if you know your way around it.\" Usko couldn't help but twitch his ears momentarily, glancing away with his wine-colored eyes to meet with a miscellaneous object of the room. The nameless Vulpera sitting across from him didn't seem to respond, but Usko continued. \"I wouldn't sweat it, bro. You'll be fine! If anything, I'll throw 'ya a bone so that my dad doesn't get too pissy if you slack off.\" The orange fox smiled, dragging his bottle up to his lips to take a satisfying swig, before placing it back down against the table, audibly making a clanking sound against the lumber. \"That really means a lot, Usko. Thank you, and don't worry about your dad. I know I'll be fine.\" As he spoke, his voice was a bit more smoother compared to Usko's voice. Nevertheless, it was a conversation with plentiful to offer. The night was quite early, and the both of them were enjoying their time before proceedings came back to normal the next day.\n\nThe group continued to chat indistinctly about an object within the caravan, as the winds outside picked up for a moment and tossed and moved at the dust in the wake of the gloomy desert night. The serenity of the night's routine would immediately be broken, however, as the sudden distant noise of a crackle and crash occurs, loud enough to catch the two off guard, sounding quite muffled inside, but was enough to echo through the valley. As drunk as Usko was, he placed his paw down on the table. \"Wait. Hold on. Did 'ya hear that?\" His expression piqued with curiosity - not one of fear by any means, but genuine interest. He glanced about the room momentarily, before looking toward the curtained small window beside them. He was able to get a peek outside using the method, but there was nothing suspicious within the visibility range of the window. He continued to peer his eyes searchingly however, in hopes that he may find a source to the noise.\n\nA few moments pass before a sudden, distant growl was heard, but it was such a low and slow grumble that it could shake anything and everything nearby - it was a growl of atrocious sounding, and most likely audibly signaled with the worst of intentions. Even Usko could hear it sonorously through the vibrations of the mobile tent. Usko idly tensed, though feeling no reason for alarm, opened his muzzle to speak. \"Just be on guard. Somethin' could be out there...\" In the middle of Usko saying that, the growling continues, but it certainly sounds like it became closer, and louder... way too close.\n\nBefore Usko could mutter any other sentence, a sudden rocking motion of the caravan threw them off guard, the inevitable rocking gravitational force slamming them against one side of the inner wall, before everything around them is literally flipped upside down and thrown within different directions. The sound of the rumbling was egregious, and within a mere second everything that was serene about the caravan, was now a destructed, decimated pile of mess. The two foxes had survived, a bit injured from the harsh blow of the wooden structure falling over them. Usko, as determined and strengthened as he was, grunted for a moment, \"Nnnrrrgh!\" as he made his way out through the heavy pieces of lumber, looking around him now as the caravan had seemingly been destroyed within seconds... But by what? By who? And why? Usko looked around for a moment before he found his companion, a bit brazenly hit but enough to recover. Usko reached over and grasped at his paw momentarily as he looked around. \"Are you alright?!\" The orange fox briefly nodded, reaching for his defensive utensils while Usko fetches for his weapon among the rubble, which under the circumstances of everything being a destroyed mess, was proving difficult. The red fox gulped momentarily. This may very well be the first time they may be in trouble.\n\nBefore the Vulpera could muster any other thought from his head, a bouldering lingering presence stood before them and the remnants of their caravan. It was extremely difficult to tell out the nature of what the beast was, but it was very certain that the beast was at the very least, feral in some nature, but large enough to overcome the two easily. With no time to react, Usko reached at the other Vulpera's paws. \"Come, quickly!\" Usko had to think of a plan, quickly. It was either one of them survive, both of them do in a miraculous way, or none of them don't. With seconds to think, Usko dashed toward the direction of the cave nearest to where they had parked the caravan, as the beast let off a wolf-like growl and a snarl, slobbering away at the loss of saliva control along its mouth as it raced to catch the two little vermin. They were considerably fast for their size, but the creature was getting closer. It didn't seem like they were focused on a target, but rather, at just some -thing-. The vulpera glanced about his surroundings, refusing to look back for a moment before he pushed the other fox's momentum forward a bit to boost his speed, pointing to a direction that was adjacent to where he was about to direct the beast to.{/col}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}\"I'll distract him! Run and get help from the nearest camp, I'll catch up to you! Don't look back! RUN!\" Usko insisted, and with the vulpera having no time to think, even despite leaving his friend, did what he was told, scurrying off into the direction adjacent, while Usko fled directly into the cave, hurriedly searching for a match to light while in the cave. But even whilst being in there, the reflection of the moonlight gave a dim ambiance to it. The cave was not a deep one - it was more of a small chasm than anything, a simple dead end of a hole inside the rock. Usko peered searchingly, nervously, with his heart racing and filled with adrenaline. Suddenly, the loud and abundant reverb of the small chasm sounded with the echoes of the beast's feral instinctual growling, the rumble of his snarls chilling Usko to the bone. Usko raises his paws upward for a moment, almost refusing to meet with the eyes of whoever or whatever it was. He had no choice, even if it was inevitable. He dashed sideways to attempt to deflect or otherwise confuse the beast, but the bouldering presence kept them at bay with a harsh slash of their claws, creating three deep lacerations that pierced Usko's skin on his cheeks, and trickles of crimson red blood quickly ooze and seep into his fur, dripping rapidly down the side of his face. Usko let off a terrifying, ravaging scream that felt like it almost rocked the cave, but it was a genuine blood-curdling yelp of distress, before he is knocked to the ground. He quickly tried to get himself back up for a moment, dusting himself off from the sand, as for one way or another, Usko had wished for it to be over, whether it was him surviving or not. While the furred beast had still not been described, its shadowy presence over the struggling fox, another snarl emanated from its mouth, before forcefully grasping him. Usko panicked, closing his eyes. The last thing Usko could hear and feel is the vibrations emanating from the beast's snarls against his neck, and a brief moment of a sharp biting pain against his neck, and before long, it was nothing. A coyote could be heard distantly wailing in the background.{/col}{/p}\n\n",

(6/10/2021){/col}{/p}\n\n{h1:c}{col:7738b0}The Red Herring (Backstory){/h1}{p:c}{col:ffffff}\nA captivating night sky blanketed over the globular horizon that encompassed the hills and trails of the sand-filled dunes, knolls and bluffs of the shiny shale seemed to stretch for miles, hills and valleys constructed by nothing more than the processes of meteorological wind. If stars could make sound, the entire sky would be filled with it. Endless splotches peppered the sky, some twinkling and some large in size. Within the vast, boundless ambit of soil, lied a dimly-lit wooden structured carriage that was quite ample for a small family, but it was certainly enough space for the two occupants to navigate comfortably, for the time being. For the night, they had been nestled abscondly within the reaches of a cliff that overlooked a part of the sandy hills, next to an enclosed cave that showed no signs of illumination or life within, but was certainly highlighted by the inescapable reflective rays of the moon's gleam toward the valley.\n\nInside the mobile wooden vehicle, which was well structured enough to keep cozy comfort, was occupied by two male Vulpera of the same stature, but very distinct from the color of their fur. Each of them were donned with the garments akin to that of their race's heritage armor, but fitted for more comfort, and with a seal that seemed to symbolize the caravan's family icon. The red-furred Vulpera was decorated with splotches of purple, attributed to his markings, with a much shorter snout than the other darker orange Vulpera sitting beside him. The retinas of his eyes beamed with a rich, pure mahogany color, whilst the nameless orange fox carried a lilac color along his iris. The name tag printed on the fabric of the red fox's tabard read, 'USKO PERIKATO'. Both of them sat idly across eachother, a few scattered empty bottles against the well-defined timber that made up the table they used. Usko let off a stifled boisterous exhale of laughter, as it certainly seemed like he was considerably under the influence, but not so much to render him as innate as most would consider. He set the bottle of cider aside, as the orange Vulpera did the same. They were seemingly trading a joke about something. Usko broke the silence in the room for a moment, his smooth voice reverberating through the enclosed wooden walls.\n\n\"I mean, like-- Thankfully we don't have to do all that work tomorrow! Your ol' man said we can spread it out over the weekend. It's been, like, HELLA tough comin' through these part of the dunes, but even my dad says it's a piece of cake, if you know your way around it.\" Usko couldn't help but twitch his ears momentarily, glancing away with his wine-colored eyes to meet with a miscellaneous object of the room. The nameless Vulpera sitting across from him didn't seem to respond, but Usko continued. \"I wouldn't sweat it, bro. You'll be fine! If anything, I'll throw 'ya a bone so that my dad doesn't get too pissy if you slack off.\" The orange fox smiled, dragging his bottle up to his lips to take a satisfying swig, before placing it back down against the table, audibly making a clanking sound against the lumber. \"That really means a lot, Usko. Thank you, and don't worry about your dad. I know I'll be fine.\" As he spoke, his voice was a bit more smoother compared to Usko's voice. Nevertheless, it was a conversation with plentiful to offer. The night was quite early, and the both of them were enjoying their time before proceedings came back to normal the next day.\n\nThe group continued to chat indistinctly about an object within the caravan, as the winds outside picked up for a moment and tossed and moved at the dust in the wake of the gloomy desert night. The serenity of the night's routine would immediately be broken, however, as the sudden distant noise of a crackle and crash occurs, loud enough to catch the two off guard, sounding quite muffled inside, but was enough to echo through the valley. As drunk as Usko was, he placed his paw down on the table. \"Wait. Hold on. Did 'ya hear that?\" His expression piqued with curiosity - not one of fear by any means, but genuine interest. He glanced about the room momentarily, before looking toward the curtained small window beside them. He was able to get a peek outside using the method, but there was nothing suspicious within the visibility range of the window. He continued to peer his eyes searchingly however, in hopes that he may find a source to the noise.\n\nA few moments pass before a sudden, distant growl was heard, but it was such a low and slow grumble that it could shake anything and everything nearby - it was a growl of atrocious sounding, and most likely audibly signaled with the worst of intentions. Even Usko could hear it sonorously through the vibrations of the mobile tent. Usko idly tensed, though feeling no reason for alarm, opened his muzzle to speak. \"Just be on guard. Somethin' could be out there...\" In the middle of Usko saying that, the growling continues, but it certainly sounds like it became closer, and louder... way too close.\n\nBefore Usko could mutter any other sentence, a sudden rocking motion of the caravan threw them off guard, the inevitable rocking gravitational force slamming them against one side of the inner wall, before everything around them is literally flipped upside down and thrown within different directions. The sound of the rumbling was egregious, and within a mere second everything that was serene about the caravan, was now a destructed, decimated pile of mess. The two foxes had survived, a bit injured from the harsh blow of the wooden structure falling over them. Usko, as determined and strengthened as he was, grunted for a moment, \"Nnnrrrgh!\" as he made his way out through the heavy pieces of lumber, looking around him now as the caravan had seemingly been destroyed within seconds... But by what? By who? And why? Usko looked around for a moment before he found his companion, a bit brazenly hit but enough to recover. Usko reached over and grasped at his paw momentarily as he looked around. \"Are you alright?!\" The orange fox briefly nodded, reaching for his defensive utensils while Usko fetches for his weapon among the rubble, which under the circumstances of everything being a destroyed mess, was proving difficult. The red fox gulped momentarily. This may very well be the first time they may be in trouble.\n\nBefore the Vulpera could muster any other thought from his head, a bouldering lingering presence stood before them and the remnants of their caravan. It was extremely difficult to tell out the nature of what the beast was, but it was very certain that the beast was at the very least, feral in some nature, but large enough to overcome the two easily. With no time to react, Usko reached at the other Vulpera's paws. \"Come, quickly!\" Usko had to think of a plan, quickly. It was either one of them survive, both of them do in a miraculous way, or none of them don't. With seconds to think, Usko dashed toward the direction of the cave nearest to where they had parked the caravan, as the beast let off a wolf-like growl and a snarl, slobbering away at the loss of saliva control along its mouth as it raced to catch the two little vermin. They were considerably fast for their size, but the creature was getting closer. It didn't seem like they were focused on a target, but rather, at just some -thing-. The vulpera glanced about his surroundings, refusing to look back for a moment before he pushed the other fox's momentum forward a bit to boost his speed, pointing to a direction that was adjacent to where he was about to direct the beast to.{/col}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}\"I'll distract him! Run and get help from the nearest camp, I'll catch up to you! Don't look back! RUN!\" Usko insisted, and with the vulpera having no time to think, even despite leaving his friend, did what he was told, scurrying off into the direction adjacent, while Usko fled directly into the cave, hurriedly searching for a match to light while in the cave. But even whilst being in there, the reflection of the moonlight gave a dim ambiance to it. The cave was not a deep one - it was more of a small chasm than anything, a simple dead end of a hole inside the rock. Usko peered searchingly, nervously, with his heart racing and filled with adrenaline. Suddenly, the loud and abundant reverb of the small chasm sounded with the echoes of the beast's feral instinctual growling, the rumble of his snarls chilling Usko to the bone. Usko raises his paws upward for a moment, almost refusing to meet with the eyes of whoever or whatever it was. He had no choice, even if it was inevitable. He dashed sideways to attempt to deflect or otherwise confuse the beast, but the bouldering presence kept them at bay with a harsh slash of their claws, creating three deep lacerations that pierced Usko's skin on his cheeks, and trickles of crimson red blood quickly ooze and seep into his fur, dripping rapidly down the side of his face. Usko let off a terrifying, ravaging scream that felt like it almost rocked the cave, but it was a genuine blood-curdling yelp of distress, before he is knocked to the ground. He quickly tried to get himself back up for a moment, dusting himself off from the sand, as for one way or another, Usko had wished for it to be over, whether it was him surviving or not. While the furred beast had still not been described, its shadowy presence over the struggling fox, another snarl emanated from its mouth, before forcefully grasping him. Usko panicked, closing his eyes. The last thing Usko could hear and feel is the vibrations emanating from the beast's snarls against his neck, and a brief moment of a sharp biting pain against his neck, and before long, it was nothing. A coyote could be heard distantly wailing in the background.{/col}{/p}\n\n",

A hybrid of heavy plated armor and voldunai attire, with a logo that seemingly takes resemblance to a local caravan group, perhaps? Perhaps he is a source and manifestation of all hatred, perhaps an entity born by the process of an innocent mortal being having their darkness sucked out of them for the sole purposes of being researched on, due to the discovery of a powerful light beaming within him that was otherwise tainted and suppressed by the darkness?
